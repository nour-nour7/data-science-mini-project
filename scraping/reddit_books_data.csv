I couldn't finish the dune series.,Celesticalking,242,0.8,383,2025-09-16 12:19:26,I have been reading the dune series for awhile now. I reached the fourth book but I just can't seem to finish it. I already took forever to finish the first three books but this fourth one is a really slow read. The slow pacing is killing me. I've read over half of the book and I feel like nothing actually happened in the past 320 pages.  I don't feel any connection to the characters expect for Duncan and Sonia. I feel like the first book was the last book I actually enjoyed reading in the serie,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1niclwf/i_couldnt_finish_the_dune_series/,,books
"East Lynne, or the Earl’s Daughter, by Ellen Wood (1861)",arrec,28,0.95,12,2025-09-16 23:28:39,"One of the best-known sensation novels from the 1860s, *East Lynne* is irresistible, with its lively prose, slangy dialogue, vivid characters, and melodramatic events. From a velvet gout stool in the first paragraph to the pious summing-up in the last, the Victorian hits just keep on coming: aristocracy, debt, adultery, spinsters, suppressed love, disguise, consumption, false accusations, suffering mothers, dying children, politics, and revenge. 



The convoluted plot concerns the classic Victo",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1nistes/east_lynne_or_the_earls_daughter_by_ellen_wood/,,books

Her writing is poetic, but what truly inspires me is who she is as a person. Her wit, humor, irony, and unapologetic feminism is so inspiring.

"Banned Books Discussion: September, 2025",AutoModerator,32,0.71,25,2025-09-16 19:00:46,"Welcome readers,

Over the last several weeks/months we've all seen an uptick in articles about schools/towns/states banning books from classrooms and libraries. Obviously, this is an important subject that many of us feel passionate about but unfortunately it has a tendency to come in waves and drown out any other discussion. We obviously don't want to ban this discussion but we also want to allow other posts some air to breathe. In order to accomplish this, we're going to post a discussion thr",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1niliqv/banned_books_discussion_september_2025/,,books
Thank-you Robert Munsch,thesweeterpeter,313,0.93,27,2025-09-16 04:04:06,"Early today I read about your decision. I've been overwhelmed with so many emotions about it, and I've felt compelled to tell you, or the world, or whoever would listen - how much you mean to me. I've been saddened, but I also feel a certain level of gratitude that you're going to allow us all to say good bye to you. And in this moment, I want to say good bye, in this way, and I invite other to as well. I hope somehow this gets to you.
