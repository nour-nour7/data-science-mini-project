Choosing a language to write my book,"Hello everyone! 

I’m from Brazil, but I write in my native language (Portuguese) and english. I’ve recently started to write my first novel after writing some short stories, but I’m kind stuck with which language should I write this book. 

If I write in my native language I might be able to find a publisher and have physical copies of the book, see it in bookstores, book festivals, whatever. 
If I write it in english I might have a wider audience and sometimes (for some unknown reason) I write better and faster in english.

Now I don’t know how to continue my book because I can’t choose one language. I’m thinking about just writing in whatever one I feel better, having a Frankenstein of a book and when it’s time to make revisions I’ll just go with the language used most often. 

What do you suggest? Should I write in one language, go through editing, translate it to the second one and query in my country and to international publishers at the same time and whomever - if anyone - picks the book first “wins”?

Or should I go straight to self publishing so I own all the rights and publish in both languages? 

If so, how do I pick one and stick with it through the writing process?

I know it can sound silly but I can’t choose and it’s making me not write in any language at the moment which is stressing me out way more than it should. ",2,4,2025-09-23,missborealiz,N/A,1.0
Experiences with self-publishing services in India?,"Hi everyone,

I’m an author in India, finishing up my first English-language book. I’m looking into self-publishing options here, but it’s hard to know which ones are trustworthy.

On the surface, these services look professional, but I’ve read mixed reviews online — some say the process is smooth, while others mention problems with royalties, weak marketing, or poor support.

If anyone has *personally published* through an Indian self-publishing service:

* How was the print and cover quality?
* Did you receive royalties clearly and on time?
* How good was the actual distribution (Amazon, Flipkart, bookstores, international)?
* Were the paid packages (like editing and marketing) worth it?

And for those of you outside India — would you recommend skipping local services and going straight with Amazon KDP or IngramSpark instead?

I’d really value some honest experiences before making a choice. Thanks!",1,0,2025-09-22,Spiritual-Put2021,N/A,1.0

Is an ARC strategy worth the effort? What works best?,"I am working on my second novel, and have given way too little thought to promotion with the first.

"Matte or Glossy, Paperback or Hardcover, Dimensions...","Hi everyone!

I need your help. I have a project that is more or less 125 000 words. It's the first book of a SF trilogy. I am going to go with Amazon KDP and the graphic designer doing my cover asked me for more infos: Paperback vs Hardback, book dimension, matte or glossy...

I would like to know what did you go for and what would you recommend?   
  
\- Should I offer both option to buy (Paperback and Hardcover), or focus only on one ? (If I do, which one?)   
\- Which dimensions should I go for? I don't like tall and large books, so I was thinking to go for 5.25"" x 8"" for the paperback and 5,5"" x 8,5"" for the hardcover

Good at writing bad at marketing,"Seeking Advice: Promoting My Books & Getting Honest Reviews (Non-Fiction + Children’s Books)

Hi everyone,

I’m currently working in two different book niches:

For adults: high-content non-fiction (politics, philosophy, psychology).

For kids: educational and illustrated color books.

I’ve invested a lot of time and effort into these projects, but I’m struggling with the promotion side and would really appreciate advice from this community.

What I’m hoping to learn:

Marketing strategies → What are the most effective free or low-cost ways to promote books on social media, blogs, or even here on Reddit?

Reviews → How can I connect with readers or reviewers who are open to leaving honest feedback?

My short-term goal is to generate around 10 organic sales and a few reviews to validate the work before I consider scaling up with paid ads or bigger promotions.

Thanks so much in advance — I’d truly appreciate any guidance, even if it’s constructive criticism.",11,14,2025-09-18,bulangieala,N/A,0.92

Anyone have Podium ghost them?,"

I've heard good things about Podium for audiobooks and was excited when they reached out to obtain rights to my series. However, I've been ghosted by them. I'm curious if others had a similar experience... Podium reached out to me, I did a video call, and then tried to negotiate a little at the front end. They wouldn't budge on anything I asked and then sent the contract. I am part of the Author's Guild where they do free contract reviews. Sent the contract to AG and they sent a good amount of very helpful feedback to negotiate with. I wasn't asking for the moon, just standard protections that the AG recommended. And now Podium has ghosted me, hasn't responded to that email a month ago or the follow up email I sent two weeks ago. Seems a bit unprofessional that they wouldn't even respond, especially in relation to author protections, when negotiating is a typical part of the contract process.

"Barnes and Noble Press Sucks, Anyone Else Have Problems?","I've been trying to get my hardback children's book ""put on sale"" for over a month. First they screwed up the ISBN by claiming it wasn't valid when their (presumably automated) system thought it conflicted with the Bowker ISBN that i purchased for the book.

I had to send multiple help requests in to get that resolved because god forbid an actual human being is able to talk to you on the phone (they don't even have a number you can call).

Now after it's cleared the ""publishing"" step, I've been waiting three weeks after selecting ""put book on sale"" and having sent in multiple help requests i get an answer that says they're behind because of the volume of requests, check back next week. Then next week comes and I check back and the response is ""I've asked someone about it"", nothing further.

Log in today to discover my book is ""off sale"" and I have the option of starting the whole ""put on sale"" cycle all over again. Still haven't heard anything from anyone about anything.

People make lots of complaints about Amazon and IngramSpark but I was able to upload a fresh manuscript, and get a book on sale in 24 hours on each sight.

Have other people had this issue with BNP?

It's absolutely infuriating that I can't get a human being to help me, and it's just endless automated (probably AI powered) responses.

Ways to monitor book interest that are NOT sales or followers,"Hi!  This is a really niche question, but I'm hoping y'all will have insight.  When you're just starting out and don't have a lot of sales yet, what are some OTHER ways you can gauge interest/awareness of your book?  Said a different way, how can you tell month to month that your marketing will *eventually* make a difference, even if your sales aren't skyrocketing (yet).

Here are some metrics I've thought of, that checking them on a monthly basis might give you some interesting information (although I don't think they're equally useful):

\- Newsletter subscribers

\- Social media followers

\- Views/engagement on social media posts

\- How many people are 'currently reading' or 'want to read' your book on Goodreads

\- Author website visits or blog subscriptions

\- Author followers on Goodreads

\- Percentage of ARC reviewers actually leaving reviews (I'm assuming here that the more folks like the book, the more likely they are to review.  Although I saw vastly different review rates across different ARC platforms.)

KU or go wide?,"Hi everyone.
I know this debate is as old as time but let me explain my angle.
I want to know if I can make money doing Kindle Unlimited in 2025 in the US.
I’m not talking about becoming rich, but enough to create a consistent income.
My 2 main genres are Fantasy and Sci-fi and I do everything from short storied to novels. I also love writing and can do it all day so I am ok with a rapid publication cycle which some have suggested is needed to be successful on KU.
My main reason for looking at KU is I have been a KU reader so I know the pros personally. The idea of having an unlimited library of books and the fact you are able to take a chance on Any of them without having to pay per book is huge!
I also have read that KU helps greatly in discovery so that’s big for me too. I know you still have to do your own marketing regardless but having that discovery engine has to help.

He was in recovery for 580 days, he relapsed in March of this year and died. The book I'm writing is a self help for parents to be able to read the signs of fentanyl use. Since I had no clue what to look for I'm guessing there are more parents out there who don't have a clue either.  

I'm bombarded by ads from ""self publishing"" companies but once I check them out they all seem pretty sketchy. There is always something off about the way they do business. I've worked in  commercial printing and I'm a graphic designer my husband and I own a small print shop. I've asked simple questions like about file formats for instance, and I get off the wall answers. I'm almost to the point where if I'm going to pay for anything it might as well be for the equipment to print it myself. Very frustrating 😡

Where do you publish your books?,"I wanted to use amazon, but  the list price is 9,34€, because with 7% VAT (Germany), it would be 9,99€.  
I'd have a Royalty Rate of 50 %; printing Costs of 3,61 €, and thus an estiamted royalty of 1,06€.

Is that normal for self publisher, or did I just picked the wrong site?",6,6,2025-09-07,EinfachIlya,N/A,1.0
Promotion Scams,"Has anyone else had a recent spate of promotion scams?

A few weeks ago I received a synopsis of my books that was clearly AI-generated. However, they were well done, included the primary characters, discussed in proper context, and accurately tied them to current events. 

Although I knew it was AI, I responded on the premise, if they can do AI that well, perhaps they can do an equally good job with book promotion. After a few emails they eventually asked for a wire transfer, a telltale sign of a scam.

I responded that this was clearly a scam and dropped the conversation. They sent several more trying to entice me. Then, I received another dozen or so AI-written emails, all a bit different (and all accurate), all from different email addresses. I have ignored them all.

Now, I am receiving emails from other 'authors' wanting to 'connect', but they are all Gmail addresses, another red flag.

Just curious of others have been experiencing anything similar.

Amazon KDP proof copies delayed—anyone else?,"I’m stuck in proof-copy limbo with Amazon KDP and I’m beyond frustrated. I ordered proofs for my children’s book, and the delivery date has changed three times (Sep 2 → Sep 5 → Sep 6). Now it just says “Delayed, not shipped yet.”

Every time I contact customer service, they say “it will arrive tomorrow,” but it’s obvious the books haven’t even been printed yet. I can’t move forward with publishing until I review the proofs, and this delay is making me nervous about my launch timeline.

Has anyone else dealt with this recently? Did you solve it by re-ordering, ordering author copies instead, or just waiting it out? Any tips would be appreciated!",0,5,2025-09-07,YumusKedi,N/A,0.5
Ingramspark not using the Canadian retail price for my book,"Hello,

I just got my first book published using Ingramspark. I noticed that IS is isn't using the retail price that I listed for Canada. Instead, it used the US price and converted to CAD. So my 26 USD book is being listed at approximately 38 CAD in Canadian bookstores, which is supposed to be 24 CAD. I am not sure if anyone will buy a 38 CAD children's book.

"Review for Barnes Noble Publishing Company (not Barnes & Noble, although the logo at the top is B&N with Publishing House underneath.)","Working with this company on my debut novel was one of the most frustrating and costly experiences I could imagine. For six months, I went in circles just trying to get my manuscript edited — errors fixed in one round would mysteriously reappear in the next. My repeated questions about marketing were ignored until everything was rushed in the final week, and it showed: my launch was a complete disaster.

To this day, my book is still not uploaded to the 40+ platforms I was promised. Other than Amazon it was only uploaded to IngramSpark, however, when I checked IngramSpark weeks later, I discovered my listing was marked **inactive** because the cover had not been formatted correctly — and it remains wrong. Despite asking repeatedly for the full list of promised platforms so I could handle uploads myself, I have received nothing. I paid for distribution that simply never happened.

The print edition went live with glaring mistakes — misaligned cover, placeholder text on the acknowledgments page, unreadable synopsis, and no review copy sent to me before launch. I had asked for a copy of the book prior to the launch and was told “it was on the way”. I never got it and the book went live before the mistakes could be identified and corrected. I received a book after launch that they ordered from LuLu, who confirmed the book was not ordered until after the launch. In the acknowledgements page instead of inserting my website it read \[Website domain here\]. The eBook was uploaded in the *wrong format twice*, making it literally unreadable on launch day. It was uploaded as a fixed format instead of reflowable format. Therefore, it had page numbers, large chapter heads, and it did not conform to the device it was uploaded to. The text did not flow to the edges and the only way to read each page was to manually use your fingers to widen the page. Trying to make the font larger in the eBook device did nothing because it was uploaded in a “fixed” format. I had to hire a freelancer to fix in less than 24 hours what Barnes failed to fix in six months. I had friends and family calling me immediately with all these mistakes and  worse yet, friends and family OF my friends and family, were making contact regarding the error. To say this was embarrassing is an understatement, I was humiliated and so very disappointed that my launch day was a disaster.

I completed all website, social media, and marketing documents in early April. Repeated requests for updates and reviews were brushed off with, “no worries, it’s being worked on,” when clearly, they were not. On launch day, all four social media posts went out at once, without my review or approval — including one that spelled “Author” as “Athuor.” I was promised eight weeks of posts, but I never even received the final four.

The website was an outright privacy and professional nightmare. All of the social media buttons linked to the same place — my **personal Facebook page**, exposing not only my private posts but also pictures of my **minor daughter and granddaughter**. Because Barnes never made me administrator of my own author accounts prior to launch, I was powerless to correct these errors. The site also contained wrong contact information and other careless mistakes. Ultimately, I had to hire another freelancer to completely overhaul the website and to fix and separate the social media integration. Ultimately, after many, many emails and conversations, I was given administrator access to all, but none was ever fixed. I do not know how to do these things so I could do nothing. When it was clear that this was not going to be corrected, I again hired a freelancer to redo all of it.

The book trailer was so off-base it looked like a pharmaceutical ad. My main character was a blond haired blue eyed Caucasian 16-year-old girl whose family lived on a lake. The trailer opened with a beach scene and then showed a 20 something Asian woman sitting in a generic office talking to a woman in a white doctor coat and then a scene with that same girl sitting at a table by herself sorting and taking medicine. They put in a two second shot of an ambulance with a flashing light but given the context of the other parts of the video it made no sense. It was hideous and again I paid a freelancer to redo the whole thing. In the book, my character was in a serious medical crisis and obviously her parents were with her. So this Asian girl and the scenes made no sense and in no way illustrated what my book was even about. Promised blogs, A+ content, and marketing assets such as top tier rankings on Amazon were either half-done, extremely late, or never delivered at all. The A+ blogs were delivered six weeks after launch and were pathetic. It appeared to have parts of my book cover on as the background, but instead of text or wrapped text they stuck solid black rectangles over it and you only saw a small sliver of anything behind it. I did not even bother to ask it to be fixed given that my book had been out for over six weeks, I just did them myself and turned them into Barnes to upload to Amazon for me. Are those on Amazon now..nope. The rankings badge never happened at all. I have every email and pings from their basecamp internal server, every follow up email following all conversations, receipts from freelancers with cost and an itemized review of what they did. I have all emails from Amazon KDP regarding all of the uploads, and several email from Ingramsparks regarding cover. 

I could go into so much more detail, but I think anyone reading this can get the gist of it. In the end, I had to pay multiple freelancers to redo nearly everything I had already paid Barnes for. They either did things wrong, did them poorly, or didn’t do them at all. My debut launch, which should have been a milestone, turned into an embarrassment. I cannot recommend this company to anyone. Make sure you research and read as many reviews on a company as possible. I am sure there are really good self-publishing companies out there, but Barnes Noble Publishing Company is not one of them. They will promise you a cut diamond, but ultimately give you a cheap glass replica at best. They even answer the phone number on their website, ""Barnes and Noble""

Where can i get reviews?,"hey guys, i am a new book author, i am a 19 years old teenager. i published my first book in may. its a romantic suspense book. its supposed to be the first in a series of 4/5 books.
i have been struggling to promote my book since. 
i only have one book sale since the publication.
i asked the other day how can i market my book and people told me i should focus on getting reviews.
but i have no idea how to. other than reaching out to Book influencers that end up not responding or not giving a review after they received a Free ebook.
and the pr packages over socials are too expensive for me  some asked for 300$+ ( i am a uni student with no source of income so i don’t have the money to splurge) 
so can anyone please tell me how they found their own arcs? even if its some trusted sites they have used i would check it out if its worth it! and is it okay that i’m still looking for arc even after having my book published for three months and something?

Anyone else give up?,"Hi,

I may have given up too soon. I released my first novel in 2023. Tried to hire two separate companies to promote my work. They botched it and I had to demand a refund from one and the other one I refused to sign a contract. 

I tried to do it myself, had a beautiful website, a new but intriguing Tiktok, etc. Then I lost money on the publication, I made something like 300.00 and spent a total of 2k. 

Genre is dark adult fantasy. I also got discouraged because the subgenre feels oversaturated and I feel like less and less people actually read these days. Also, I got stuck probably about a third of the way into the sequel and never finished. The idea was promising, but the entire first book I switched from the MC's pov to another male protagonist's pov. 

Long story short, in the sequel the MC lost her memory and didn't know who she was, so I used third person when writing about her, but most of the time I was following the male protagonist. I didn't connect very well with his character as I did with the female MC. 

Does anyone think I gave up too soon? I just felt like, at this point in my life, it would take up much more time and effort than it's worth if I can't make a career out of it. 

I know they say, ""do it 'cause you love it, not 'cause it makes you money,"" but I really want to work on something that will grow and eventually sell. Plus, the sequel was harder to focus on at the time I put it down, aforementioned above.

Christian - looking to co-author in publishing a book,"I have been a Christian more than 20 years now, coming from another faith. My faith journey has been painful and arduous but it seems that it's been worth it. I have tried to write down my thoughts before, and revelations so to speak, but I have failed for a large part. That was sometime ago, when everything seemed new and exciting.

But I've graduated from a Christian graduate school 10 years ago and am now graduating from my second Masters - M.Div from in one of the better Christian schools in the country. Having said that - I've gotten better at writing and documentation. I've written some pretty good papers, and have a personal blogs.

Published authors? Check you Amazon categories. They've changed at some point in recent years.,"Hi everyone! I was just doing a quick double-check and update on my novels in preparation for launching a podcast that is going to plug my books from time to time, and I spotted all the categories I had chosen when I published between 2012 and 2018 are no longer options. I have to think that means Amazon has refined how it is directing people's search and referral results and left my stuff out of whatever the current system is set up to do. It's probably worth all of us having a quick check to make sure the categories we've chosen are still active and accurate. You can pick up to three per book.

I plan on taking a copy to show them, of course, but do I just explain I am a self published author, and that the book is on Ingram, and then they order it if they want to?

Should I bring some kind of business card or a one-sheet synopsis with the ISBN, my name and contact details? 

Is there any negotiating, or agreement to be made, or do they just log on and order books at a later time, without any of that? (Should they decide to, of course!) 

Will they say how many copies they'll order? 

What sort of questions should I be prepared to answer?

An A4 sheet showing the book cover, my name and email, some pages from inside (it's a picture book) and the blurb. 

The shop manager was very friendly and lovely and asked me to add my number to the sheet. She had some questions about the target age, and said she'd maybe do an 'order to return' which is fine with me. She suggested I might do a reading or something in-store, which sounds fab. She even recommended another bookshop to try, who she knows works with local authors. She said if I don't hear from her in a week or two, to remind her. I didn't feel brushed off because she was adamant that I get back to her if she didn't contact me first. She said 'I love your press release', referring to my page.

Case Study: My first KDP free promo with 0 followers. 46 downloads & a #1 category rank so far.,"I am taking a leap of faith and waiting for the constructive feedback. Please be kind. I'm new to all of this. I made and error yesterday thinking all I was supposed to do was come on here and announce  my new venture.

Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I wanted to share some real-time data from my very first launch, hoping it can help or encourage someone else on the fence.

For years, I was held back by the idea that books were only written by ""the best."" But with all the tools available now, that barrier in my mind started to crack. So I said, ""what the heck,"" and over the course of a weekend, I wrote a short book about what I do and how I do it.

**The Setup (and a lesson learned):**

* **Platform:** Absolute zero. No email list, no social media followers, no one waiting for it.
* **Process:** I used the tools I had on hand to write and publish it in about a week.
* **Initial Mistake:** At first, I scattered it everywhere—my own site, Gumroad, and Amazon. I was quickly advised to focus on one platform. Ironically, this is a point I make in my own book, so I took the advice.
* **The Plan:** I unpublished it from other sites and committed to 90 days in KDP Select, starting with a 2-day free promo which began Friday at 3 AM EST. I've spent $0 on ads or marketing.

**The Results (Live numbers as of Saturday \~11:30 PM EST):**

The promo ends in a few hours, but I was too excited not to share. So far:

* **Downloads:** **46**
* **Overall Rank:** Currently **#3,004** in the Free Kindle Store.
* **Category Ranks:** This is what blew my mind.
   * **#1** in 45-Minute Business & Money Short Reads
   * **#2** in Startups
   * **#2** in 45-Minute Computers & Technology Short Reads

**Analysis & Questions:**

Honestly, for starting from absolutely nothing a week ago, seeing 46 people decide to download my work is an incredible feeling. Hitting a #1 spot, even in a niche subcategory, feels like a huge win and proves how important category selection is.

My main question for the veterans here is: **what now?**

Any issues with pen names different from your birth names?,"As an immigrant from Taiwan, I was given a birth name that is not English. I have not changed my legal name to my English name because I've heard somewhere it'd cost thousands of dollars. I am using my English name as I self publishing my debut novel. On eBook platforms, will I have problems receiving royalties if my legal name on my payout method (like my bank account info) profile is not the same as my English name?

Voices by Inaudio is awful,"I have been an author for years. I've made good money publishing my own titles and those of others. For a while now, I've been very satisfied with Findaway Voices. It distributed to Spotify, which is where most money was made. You could also submit through it to Audible, although it seems useless if you can just use ACX for that. And another thing it allowed was digitally narrated books, provided that you would use Google Play auto-narrated voiceovers or LPF files from Elevenlabs (which is kind of ridiculous because Play HT and some others have way better deals but oh well). 

I’ve been publishing audiobooks for a while through Findaway Voices and never had an issue. Recently, my account was migrated to Voices by InAudio, and out of nowhere, they suspended my account.

I’ve followed the rules, never had problems with Findaway, and now I can’t get clear answers from support. It feels like I’m being treated terribly after being a loyal user of the platform.

At this point, I’m feeling really frustrated, because this affects my publishing income and my trust in the platform. I don't trust them anymore. The moment this company took over, books were being delayed, rejected, and now, for the first time ever, account suspended. It's like one of those companies who came in and said, ""You've been too nice to authors. Let's crack down and exploit them. Let's ruin their lives because we're in charge.""

I had lots of plans to upload more books this year, but I just feel so angry that they abuse their power to just cut me off like that. If it's happening to you, know you're not alone in this. 

  
So yeah, here is my 1 star review of this company. Findaway Voices was nice, transparent, and polite. They helped the little guy. This company is just another monopolist trying to squeeze money out of poor people. I'm done using their platform. Don't use them. Go to Author's Republic or ACX (which I have to admit, have their own set of problems and haven't always been honest either). Findaway Voices got ruined. Spotify sold off. Voices by Inaudio is just another dishonest dictator.",8,1,2025-08-23,Mysterious-Dust-1926,N/A,1.0
Discussion about audiobook production costs,"The $200-400/hour rate everyone quotes? That's only the beginning of this expensive rabbit hole.

The standard pitch you'll hear is ""$200-400 per finished hour"" for professional narration. Okay, cool. Average book is about 8 hours, so we're looking at $1,600-3,200, right?

Wrong.

Here's what people actually end up paying: First, there's the narration at $1,600-3,200 (the part everyone talks about). Then add proofing and prep for $150-300 because your narrator needs to actually read your book first. If they're not recording at home, studio time runs $500-1,500. Post-production and mastering adds another $600-1,200 because raw audio needs serious editing. QC and corrections will set you back $200-500 because there will be mistakes. And don't forget ACX submission prep at $100-200 just to format everything correctly for the platform.

Real total? $3,250-6,900. That's 2-3x what most authors budget for.

But wait, there's royalty share! Sure, it's ""free"" upfront. But you're giving up 50% of your audiobook royalties for 7 years. Based on industry data showing average indie audiobooks sell about 150 copies in year one, at $15/book with 25% royalty, you're losing $281.25/year. Over 7 years, that's about $2,000 in opportunity cost. And here's the kicker - good narrators rarely accept royalty share without an additional stipend anyway.

What about DIY? I thought this would be the answer. Buy some equipment, record it yourself, save thousands.

The equipment setup runs $500-1,200 for a decent mic, interface, acoustic treatment, and software. Not terrible, right? But the real cost is time. Authors report spending 40-80 hours just learning how to do this properly. Recording takes 3-5x the finished length, so that's 24-40 hours for an 8-hour book. Editing and mastering needs another 2-5 hours per finished hour, so 16-40 hours. Then add 20-30% more time for re-records when you realize your dog barking ruined three chapters.

Total time investment: 80-150 hours. Even if you value your time at minimum wage, that's $1,200-2,250 worth of labor. Plus your audiobook probably won't sound as good as professional work.

At typical all-in costs of $3,250-6,900, you need to sell 867-1,840 copies at a $15 price point, or 1,300-2,760 copies at $10. Industry reports consistently show indie audiobooks average about 150 sales in year one.

That means it takes 5-12 years to break even. If your book even stays relevant that long.

I looked into alternative options too. Fiverr and Upwork narrators charge $50-150 per finished hour, but quality is a complete gamble. Authors report often hiring 2-3 people before finding someone decent, ending up spending $800-2,000 total with revisions. International narrators run $75-200 PFH, which can work great unless your target audience expects specific accents. AI narration platforms charge $20-100/month, plus you'll spend 15-25 hours processing and tweaking. The quality debate is real though - listeners can tell.

So what actually works? Based on success stories I've found, authors who make audiobooks profitable typically start with shorter books (3-5 hours) to test the market. They have an established audience already asking for audio. They use a hybrid approach with a professional narrator but self-edit. They pre-sell to gauge actual demand. Most importantly, they view the first audiobook as marketing for a series, not a profit center.

The uncomfortable truth nobody wants to admit is that unless you're already selling 500+ copies a month in other formats, audiobook production is rarely profitable. It's become more about being on all platforms than making money.

What's been your experience? Are these numbers matching what you've seen? Anyone actually making their money back on audiobook production?",3,5,2025-08-22,Icy-Respect-5299,N/A,0.81

Publishing a “writing challenge” book – any tips from self-pub authors?,"Hey folks,
I’m currently preparing a 30-day writing challenge in book format (with daily prompts, some playful bonus ones, etc.). My main goal is to create something writers can actually use daily.

For those of you who’ve self-published similar niche/non-fiction projects:
	•	Did you find ebook or print-on-demand worked better?
	•	How important was cover design vs. sample pages?
	•	And did you do a launch promo, or just let it trickle out there?

Is your cover ready for the tiny Amazon thumbnail?,"The very first thing I learned when I started working on book covers is that they have to pass the thumbnail test, especially on mobile. About 25% of readers open ebooks on their phones, and 13% read only on phones. If your cover disappears in a sea of tiny icons, it is invisible before anyone even clicks it, and you could lose a quarter of potential readers before they see the book.

**1. Strong contrast and simple shapes.** This is the first thing to check. On a small screen fine textures and thin lines fade away. Some genres like fantasy do need detailed artwork to set the right mood, but make sure the cover does not merge into one blur when it is scaled down.

**2. Title size over everything else.** At thumbnail size readers have no patience for tiny letters. A big clear title usually wins. The only exception is when you want the artwork to be the first thing people notice. In that case you can keep the title smaller, but then the visual has to carry the whole cover.

**3. Test like a reader.** I always shrink the cover to about 100 pixels wide on my phone before calling it done. Show it to a couple of friends too and ask if they can read the title and understand the main image right away. If they hesitate or squint the cover is not ready yet.

**4. Keep the genre promise clear.** A cover should instantly tell readers what kind of story they are about to open. If the genre is mystery but the colors and fonts scream romance the right readers might scroll right past it. I always double check: will someone seeing this cover for two seconds know the vibe of the book?

When a cover works at thumbnail size it looks professional and gets more clicks and sales.

Anonymity possible these days?,"I'm looking to write a series of books about some pretty remarkable experiences in my life.

Low in Sales on my two books,"I reflect from the past and present about my sales till I experienced from my publisher where he told me I am down in the rankings. I then saw a post on Facebook today about Amazon isn’t a bookstore. It’s an algorithm.

Imagine this:
You’ve spent months preparing your book. You launch it. Two weeks pass…

You’ve made a few sales, but zero reviews.
For Amazon, that’s a signal of low interest. It pushes you down in the rankings.

And once you drop… climbing back up is hard, almost impossible.

Now imagine the opposite: you launch your book, and sales plus positive reviews come in right away.

Amazon sees you’re in demand, moves you to a more visible ranking zone, and keeps you on its radar to reward your BSR.

For people who preordered the book already, will they get the new or old cover?

Also, I don't know how, but my book is already on Goodreads. Again, it's using the old cover. When might that change? I don't know where it's pulling its metadata from since I didn't submit it.

Help with Lulu Printing,"Hi everyone, I just need to know if anyone is experiencing the same issue I am. I tried looking through the subreddit but couldn't find anything. Just need some advice if someone has it because I feel like Im going crazy. For context, I used the Lulu template and the export settings for interior files

I am illustrating a children's book where some of the artwork spans across a spread. Initially InDesign was exporting the PDF with portions of the artwork towards the gutter cut off and swapped – they told me this is normal. We got the draft printed and when we received it, we noticed there were white bars cutting off the artwork close to the gutter.

Emailed them again and they said to un-check the ""Facing Pages"" option in the working file and then export. I did this, the artwork still has white rectangles going down across the page where the gutter is, 

NOW they're telling me this is a ""Trim Variance"" issue common in saddleback binding which doesn't make any sense because our first draft was printed in perfect bound and that the only way to fix it is to fade the artwork towards the gutter to white 

At this point, Im getting quite frustrated because I keep getting different answers. Has anyone else experienced this issue? How were you able to fix it?

The Struggle is Real,"I am a husband and my wife has been working on her book. It has been quite a ride and she is struggling. I think it is self doubt. I am trying to help her through this. I try to carve out time for her to try to focus, but I think she is doubting things.

She likes to read and write so I figured a website for her to write and engage with people from her social media would be beneficial. I started to look into services like Lulu as an alternative to KDP. I have seen many members that are not happy with Amazon. What I found was that I could integrate Lulu into the site to hopefully have her sell directly through the site. I just wanted to know if anyone had any experience with Lulu as a whole.

"Sold even ONE book? Congrats, you're in the 1%.","I wasted three years obsessing over making everything ""perfect"" and basically used editing as my excuse to never actually publish anything. The moment I finally hit that publish button though? Complete game changer. Random people started reading my stuff, sending me messages, telling me they stayed up way too late because they couldn't put it down.

Was it perfect? Hell no. But that one published book taught me more about writing than all those years of endless revisions combined. That messy first book made my second one better. The third one even stronger.

So seriously, celebrate that first sale. You're literally ahead of 99% of people who just talk about writing but never actually do it. And if you're still sitting there going ""just one more draft, then I'll publish""... maybe it's time to stop hiding and let your story see the light of day, flaws and all.

Self-publishing workflow suggestions,"I'm preparing to publish my first self-published novel. I have a lot of things in place already (cover, book format for ebook and paperback, ISBN) and plan to publish wide, not just with Amazon. But as I explore other things to do, such as registering the book with my ISBNs and submitting for copyright, I see that I need to have things like price already in place.

So, I'm wondering what my workflow is going to look like here. My cover designer has left the proper space on the paperback cover design for me to put in a barcode, but Bowker wants a price before I can fully register the ISBN and ask for a barcode, and the copyright people seem to want a price as well. I'm guessing I come up with prices during the upload process, but I'm not sure of how KDP, not to mention Draft2Digital or others handle things like that. Can I start the process, then stop and continue later?

The bottom line, I suppose, is what is the workflow you folks use? What does the actual publication process look like for someone doing ebook and paperback POD and publishing to more than just Amazon? I don't mind complexity, but I don't want to screw up and make a horribly embarrassing mistake.

✍️ Request for Help with Paperback Cover Formatting (Trade Offer),"
Hi everyone,
I’m in the final stretch of self-publishing my book. I’m so close to getting the paperback version out, but I’ve run into repeated issues with formatting the full wraparound cover for KDP. At this point, I’d love to hand it off to someone more experienced.

What I need:
	•	Help finalizing a KDP paperback cover
	•	I have all the components: front, back, spine text, and the correct trim size (13.14” x 9.25”)
	•	I just need someone to check alignment, embed the barcode space correctly, and export to KDP-ready PDF
	•	Bonus: someone who can double-check my 355-page manuscript PDF to ensure it lines up with KDP’s requirements

What I can offer in return:
	•	Beta reading (I’m a fast, thoughtful reader with a strong grasp of character, pacing, and theme)
	•	Editing or proofreading (I’ve already edited multiple manuscripts and know how to polish prose while respecting voice)
	•	Happy to work out a fair exchange that helps us both!

This book is really personal to me and I’ve done everything else on my own. I’d love just a little help getting it over the finish line.

Thanks so much.

"My experience with publishing, why your work depends on an audience, and how to avoid scams","So let me share a bit of my experience with publishing with you. So, ever since I first decided that I wanted to publish my work, I wanted so much to get a traditional publishing deal. I wanted to publish with a publisher in itself, rather than self-publishing. I just felt like I would never feel like an author myself if I didn’t publish with a “real” publisher. So I put a crazy amount of effort into getting my work published.

As a result, I published with an NGO, Independent Publishing, which I worked for at the moment. And they just had me doing a lot of little different tweaks and aligning the content I had to be in line with their organization’s brand. And it took a lot of effort to change my manuscript in a way I wouldn’t necessarily want to do. So I went on and published with them, and it took me about six months just to get them convinced and so on.

From that point onwards, I had already submitted a work of mine, which was kind of the same work but a little different in terms of word count, so it was more of a short story. And I had it submitted to several different publishers. And one academic publisher from the University of Tennessee reached out to me saying they wanted to publish, but it again would come with some alterations they would want to make to my manuscript. So I would start going back and forth with them, and it would take them too long to respond, and editing, all these kinds of things. And it finally got published. In that particular instance, It took probably a year, and it took over six months just to respond to me. So if I had waited for them, I wouldn’t have done anything.

And so after having this experience and going on by myself after I had first published with the NGO, I perceived that over 95% of my audience was due to my own making. Me reaching out to people, inviting them to read my work, me going on pages talking about my work. And it took a lot of me and a lot of work from me, but that was the only real way in which I got engagement. And probably after you publish, you will see that.

It’s not only publishing your manuscript that you will want. You will want to have an audience, so you will want to publish on journals, magazines, about their stories, interviews. And it is full of scams in the internet for it. So they will charge you a ridiculous amount of money for you to publish in a certain place, for certain people to interview you. You will receive sheets already made up of interview questions that you will just fit in your responses, and it isn’t really to you. And you don’t get to see the numbers. It takes a lot out of you to do that work, and you don’t know who’s engaging. You just see that the book’s not selling from those sources, because whenever those are published, you don’t see any book sales or anything.

So it’s good to have it, because it gives you authority, but it completely deconstructed my view on self-publishing, because either way, if you publish as a self-publisher or with the publisher itself, whatever you publish, none of them will give you an audience. It might be that the publisher will give you a bit more, but the hardest part is getting an audience, and that will require your work and the quality of your work in itself. Because sometimes we will think, oh, I wrote this piece, and now the work’s done, and no, it’s not done. And then you go like, no, I wrote this piece, and I got it published with a certain publisher, and now the work’s done, I’m done. And you will discover, no, the work is far away from done. It is only done when you get people reading and engaging with it, and it only happens through your work.

They will try to suck your energy to align with their content, and or they will try to suck you to make money for themselves, and you will be extorted. So be careful not to be extorted in this industry. It might be that from time to time you can pay with certain small fees to get published in certain places, but require that you will know that your work will have an audience, and you will be able to follow up with that person. And also, one more recommendation, I would say whenever you’re dealing with a person, request a call, a Zoom call, a conference, make that person available for you so that you know it’s a real person, that person is working for you, and you’re not talking to a person in whatever part of the world, just being a robot and taking money out of you.",3,1,2025-08-09,Wide_Foundation8065,Author,0.72

"I Got into 60 bookstores in 3 Months, Here’s What I Learned:","Like many of us, I had dreams of a traditional publishing deal. Querying was a soul-sucking endeavor, especially because my rejections weren’t about the writing or story, but because I didn’t have a platform. Only after 150 rejections from literary agents did I throw in the towel and come into the self-publishing mindset. It’s more work than I imagined, but I’m happy with where it’s led me and grateful to the Reddit community for all the info that helped along the way. I figured it’s time for me to share some front line intel from this grassroots experiment.

I have been living in a van with my wife for 5 years and wrote a travel memoir about our first year on the road. My wife was also writing a memoir (her book comes out via a hybrid publisher in September). After 4 years of writing/editing, we decided we would give a full year to promote. When my book came out at the end of April, 2025, we slapped some magnet signs on our home-on-wheels and set out to sell directly to readers … old school style, right out of the trunk. This was fun, way more profitable than Ingram/Amazon, and meant we could “work” while staring at the Grand Canyon. I didn’t intend to spend so much time on indie bookstores, but shortly into this endeavor, we began visiting some. I was expecting rejection or consignment offers, but what ended up happening totally shocked me. This experiment has been strictly across the American West, and while my situation is unique (2 authors, both nonfiction, the ability to drive our home across the country), some of the lessons I have gained might be helpful to my fellow indie authors.

\-Yes, I needed to be on Ingram. Yes, it needed to be the maximum discount. And yeah, a majority (but not all) bookstores request that there be an active return policy. (I chose the “destroy” option and told stores to contact me directly if they need to do a return.)

\-Don’t be fooled when the bookstore says they require a 40% discount. I got so excited when I heard this, as it meant a much higher royalty than the 55% discount. But when you put in a 55% discount on your Ingram, the stores see a 40% discount on their end. Ingram is taking the rest. To be clear: a 40% discount for the bookstore means a 55% discount for the indie author.

\-Best to lead your pitch with distribution. Walking in and saying “I’m an author” can shift one’s demeanor. Some get delighted, others get guarded. I noticed once we followed up with distribution … “I’m on Ingram, my wife is with Simon & Schuster.” … a sense of relief would wash over the guarded ones. They know you’ve done your homework, came prepared, and hopefully have invested a lot into the detail of your book.

\-It didn’t matter that my wife’s book came with Simon & Schuster distribution. I was expecting to ride her coattails, but many stores were buying my book before hers was ready for pre-order. The S&S came with some congratulations, but hasn’t seemed to made any impact into the buying decision. As long as you’re on Ingram, that’s good enough.

\-Lean into your victories. I started in Utah, where my cover art takes place. I had no victories, so I was leaning on the hopeful marketability of the book. Once I had added some stores, I could name drop that it had been picked up at XXX. This really helped, as they seem to have a lot of respect for certain stores. I also got “Top New Release” status in the Amazon category of Travel Writing during my first week. I did state this in my pitch, and I would omit that it was “on Amazon”, and no one ever questioned me or was offended by this. Each victory beefed up my pitch. Now I can say I’m the #2 Travelogue on Ingram, am in XX stores, drop some reputable names, etc. In the beginning, I really felt like a salesmen, and sometimes I still do, but more and more I’m feeling like an author.

\-Don’t assume bigger stores mean a harder sell. Surprisingly, we got plenty of email responses and invitations from big stores. If I had to guess why, it’s because they have enough staff to pass around duties. The owner/operator ones are so busy it is quite common they do little on email. Sure, we haven’t heard back from Powell’s and Tattered Cover, but I can’t say I expected to.

\-Don’t sleep on the small town stores. My best selling stores are often in smaller towns. In fact, one of my best stores is in a town I never even heard of before this trip. They also really seem to appreciate the effort to stop by, and there’s a lot less overwhelm from local authors.

\-The most important element to closing the deal is getting to speak with the right person at the right time. Most stores we didn’t get into was because we missed the buyer and were relegated to email correspondence that led to no response. We got flat-out rejections at half a dozen or so stores. Only one store chose to carry my wife’s book and not mine.

\-Respect their policies and systems. Many of these stores, especially in cities, are inundated with author requests. We took the time to review their websites and abide by their submission policies. If they say not to drop-in, we would only come if invited. We would send an intro email about 1-2 weeks before we expected to visit. Often we would call ahead to schedule the right time, and make them aware that our intro email wasn’t spam.

\-Some will buy author copies directly, but plan on following up. It kind of shocked me that I would offer stores the ability to buy signed copies directly from me at a lower price than they would get on Ingram, and they still chose Ingram. But it makes sense for their accounting and inventory systems. However, I’ve sold direct to about 40 stores to get my foot in the door. I called most of these stores 1 to 2 months afterward. The good news: my book had sold out at almost all of them! The bad news: they hadn’t re-ordered! Once my call brought it to their attention, they gladly re-ordered on Ingram, but it baffled me that so few realized they were out of stock until I called them. I’d say 75% hadn’t been notified via their inventory management. I also couldn’t believe how well it was selling!

\-No, you don’t have to do consignment. Of the 60 stores, I’m on consignment at 3 of them. The rest I’m what is called “general stock”. This is mainly because I’m not a “local author”. While I do make more money per sale on consignment, it’s one additional thing to keep track of. Not to mention that as a nomad, most of these stores mail checks or expect you to pick up payment, which isn’t compatible with our lifestyle.

\-You probably won’t be judged by your appearance, but your book sure as heck will be. I had no Kirkus Reviews, no author endorsement blurbs, no sellers looked up my rating on Goodreads or Amazon. They took in the cover art, flipped through the interior formatting (including the copyright page), and listened to my 30 second pitch/summary. They knew if it would sell or not based on its appearance and subject matter. Investing in an amazing graphic designer was so worth it. While the writing brings reviews and fan mail, it didn’t seem to have much to do with getting my foot in the door. Maybe they assumed that if I was willing to put this much work into getting picked up, I probably put even more into writing a good book.

\-We’re not entitled to anything. Unfortunately, I’ve heard some horror stories from book buyers. Indie authors who come in to drop off 100+ books, expecting them to sell all of them. Others coming in asking how to self-publish (as if they will get a tutorial). Many who just walk in and assume the store will carry it front and center. Sadly, these types have given indie authors a bad rep. Stores seem to really appreciate that we come in asking, not expecting. After all the rejections I’ve received, I learned I’m not entitled to anything in this industry.

\-I’ve only gifted about 15 books, a couple to stores I really wanted to get into that required it, the rest were for important stores that do staff reviews, so the employees could pass it around. Whenever we explained that we couldn’t giveaway books, every store was very understanding, they know you’re not making enough money to justify it and were okay with digital versions if needed.

\-Page margins = profit margins. My original font/spacing/margins had a PDF of 298 pages, and cost $4.78 to print on KDP. While I was reading it, I felt like there was so much available space on the margins, and that the font was too big and led to the read actually being too fast. So I adjusted the margins and font, which dropped the PDF to 255 pages and now cost $4.06. That’s a difference that adds up. Plus, the book actually looked/read better.

\-Expect small orders to start. Some only bought 1 or 2 copies, as a trial to see if it would sell. My largest upfront order was 8 books. Most fall in the 2-5 copies.

\-Digital does no justice. Physically going to the store, letting them hold the book, makes all the difference. I haven’t had one sell based off a PDF. Thanks to the momentum we’re getting, I’m actually having stores order based off the intro email now, asking me to sign them when I come visit.

\-Social media is not necessary but appreciated. Admittedly, I’m one of those people that doesn’t like SM. After a solid 3 years off the platforms, I got back on to promote my book. Each store that picks up our books, we take photos and post/tag about it. They seem to really appreciate the gesture and honestly, it’s probably better for us than it is for them. Most stores have more followers than I ever will, and a re-post by them reaches a lot more new readers than I would on my own.

\-Don’t say the A-word (Amazon). I’ve had some great convos with owners around the difficulties of book economics, but I always let them initiate and drop the A word. For the most part, they understand that as authors you are probably on Amazon, we just don’t have to talk about it.

\-Cover out display makes all the difference. The bookstores decide this, and since we’re not entitled to anything, it’s not something I can claim or ask for. But it was clear early on how big of an impact it has. I had a case study in a town where one store did spine out, the other did face out. Face out sold out of 8 copies in one month, spine out had sold only 1 in 3 months. I got a re-order for 20 books at the face out store, still haven’t gotten paid by the spine out store.

\-Only one store brought up our website link, which was linked directly to Amazon landing pages. They politely asked that we consider adding bookshop.org, which we did (when you sign up for Ingram it will automatically put your book there). So now our website links include all the options, and the customer can choose their route. It was an appreciated gesture. I’m also on Audible exclusive (for now) with my audiobook. While I’d love to offer Libro.FM the economics didn’t make sense and I have a lot of money to make back on that project. No store has been critical of this.

\-Bookstores are alive and well. I’ve been in probably 80 of them now, maybe 5 have admitted they weren’t sure if they were going to make it. But probably 40 of them were packed with people, even on the middle of a weekday.

\-Be prepared to meet some amazing people. I’ve interacted with over 100 booksellers now, and I can honestly say that only 2 were people I wouldn’t want to have another conversation with. That’s right, only 2 (of course they left an impression lol). I don’t know any other industry where you will find such a high percentage of supportive, kind, and welcoming people. It’s honestly made the experience so worthwhile. Most of these people are doing what they love and dreamed of doing, much like us as writers.

What would I do differently?

I would add a dollar to my MSRP. My book currently retails for $14.99 in bookstores. I wanted to keep it more affordable and more comparable to my Amazon price of $12.99. However, I see a measly $1.56 per Ingram sale with that price, which feels far from equitable and annoys me anytime I think about it. I’d love to see Ingram pay indie authors more, but until then, I should have listed for $15.99. Not one store has commented on my book’s price.

Was it worth it?

For me, it’s a yes. But if this sounds like a lot work, well you’re correct. It’s felt like a full-time job for my wife and I. However, I’ve gotten multiple emails this week from readers who found the book at one of these stores and then felt compelled to contact me about how much they gained from the story. If it is about getting read, then I can say it’s working. But, like most things, if you look at the expenses vs profits, it’s probably a no. I’ll report back in a year, to see if it led to re-orders that justify all that gas money and labor. My bookstore sales are now more than my Amazon sales; however, my profit is still higher on Amazon just because they pay us indies better.

Sorry my first post is so long. There’s so much more information that I would love to detail on a podcast or something, but hopefully some of these bullet points are helpful, and hopefully you find some inspiration and encouragement. As for me, I’ll keep leaning on this community to figure out how to get the needle moving on Amazon, which hasn’t done much for me outside of friends and family. Down the road I’ll have some more intel to share on the pros/cons of my self-published route vs my wife’s hybrid route (she also hired a publicist and I didn’t). We’re also doing a proper Fall Book Tour at many of our indie partners in the 4 corner states, so I’ll be able to comment on whether the events were worthwhile or not as well. We also narrated our own books with a production studio, so once I have enough audiobook data I can share some insights.

Officially, apart from the fictional covers I made for my portfolio, within the publishing market I've only made a poster and a bookmark for a writer friend of mine, as I did the cover and the illustrations inside my book.

It seems like all the hours I spend, both on my nonexistent freelance cover design and on writing (because despite my hard work promoting the book, I'm not even close to the top ranking on Amazon, lol, with only 2,000 pages read) are in vain. I carry my impostor syndrome so heavily, it feels like my work goes with the wind. I can't even take myself too seriously when I think about being a writer and a designer.

Writers, what tips do you have for me to get motivated to get back to marketing my book? I've been suffering from impostor syndrome for over a month now, and despite receiving positive reviews for my book, I feel like it's not enough.

And what tips do you have for finding writers who want book covers? I was reading on Reddit that a good place to start is through independent writers who want them, but even on platforms like 99designs, I can't find any work.

If anyone is curious, I leave my covers below, the first one is from my already published book, still on Amazon in Portuguese, one day I want to publish it in English, it is a fantasy with romance about a pianist who steals lost hearts through her music, trapping them in a world inside a music box, until a conductor captured by her will do everything to discover the truth about that world and her.

New scam targeting authors,"

To give you some context here first, I am a self published author of several books. I am sure this is why I got the call. 

So, a little while ago, I got a call from my 82 year old dad. Someone had called him asking for me. I haven't lived with my parents for around 30 years, so I automatically find this to be suspicious. How did they get that phone number???  The guy's name was Drake Collins. He claimed to be with a company called ""Blue Ink Media Solutions."" It was a Delaware (302) area code number. My dad wouldn't give him my number, but instead offered to call me with his info and have me call him. He cordially accepted my dad's offer to do that. 

I looked him up online, and there was a Blue Ink Media company, which is a vanity press, but it doesn't sound like anything that would be associated with anything like this. I found a couple of people named Drake Collins online, but again, they didn't seem to be associated with any Blue Ink Media Company or podcast / radio interviews. This person doesn't exist online. So, again, I find this suspicious. 

So, I called the guy to find out what he wanted, but I also took the added precaution of recording the call on my computer. When I called the number, it said that all of his calls are recorded too. Whatever. Anyway, so he answered his own phone (kinda suspicious if he is a big deal), and he speaks with a foreign accent that I can't place, even though he (supposedly) has an American name. 

He told me that he had read one of my books, that he was very impressed with it, and that he had forwarded my info to a radio talk show person named Kate Delaney. Apparently, she is a very big deal in talk radio, and has a national syndicated talk radio show. I looked her up, and this appears to be true. 

During the course of the conversation, he changed his story twice concerning her:  He told me that she wanted me on one of her shows first, then another. I asked him where he got my book. He said that he bought it off of Amazon. I have not sold any copies on Amazon. I just got it listed there, although I have sold some copies on eBay. So there's at least 2 lies. 

Then, he (finally) hits me with his pitch. He says that Kate is perfectly willing to interview me, but since she is on 210 radio stations, that there are production costs involved. He told me that I would need to cover this for the low, low price of only $3150. LOL I told him that I ""would have to research it and get back to him."" 

Obviously, this is a huge scam. I just wonder how he got my 30 year old phone number at my mom and dad's house, and I also wonder if any of you have ever heard of this scam or this person or company before?

Disappointed Self-Publishing with FriesenPress Canada– A Costly and Frustrating Experience,"I don’t typically write reviews, but my experience with FriesenPress Canada has been disappointing enough that I feel the need to share it—especially for other first-time authors considering self-publishing services.

I came in with high hopes and a clear vision, but my project has now been delayed by **months**. The primary issue? I’ve had to **micromanage every step** of the process to correct mistakes that, frankly, should never have happened in the first place. Each revision round costs me money—even when those revisions are needed because of amateur errors on their end.

Let’s start with the **cover designs**: the initial versions looked like something from the 1980s, with tiny, illegible fonts and stock images that looked outdated and low-resolution. I was shocked that a professional publishing service would submit something so underwhelming. The **interior design** wasn’t much better—layout issues, lack of polish, and clear inattention to detail. I’ve spent a ton of time (and money) reworking what should have been done well from the start.

The biggest frustration? **You can’t speak directly to the designers.** All communication has to go through a project manager, and unfortunately, mine has consistently failed to relay my instructions accurately. As a result, things get lost in translation, timelines get extended, and I’ve had to explain the same thing multiple times.

To top it off, they’ve used **low-resolution images** despite clear instructions to use high-quality ones, and I’ve had to point out basic formatting and design mistakes that a professional team should catch on their own.

In short, I feel like I’ve been **paying to do their job**—and that’s not what I signed up for.

I wouldn’t recommend FriesenPress if you’re looking for a hands-on, responsive, or truly professional publishing experience. At this point, I’m simply hoping to get my book over the finish line with as little additional frustration as possible.",2,3,2025-07-31,DayVegetable6452,N/A,0.75

Should I re-publish after changing my name?,"I don't have much out there, just a self-published novel and a handful of shorts (but a few of my shorts *were* previously other-published in anthologies....)

Since, though, I've transitioned and while they were published under a pen name anyway, it was a male pen name. And now, I'm having to rebuild my identity as a writer with a female pen name, starting from scratch essentially without that past work to refer to. 

I would *LIKE* to go back and edit those works to change the name on them which would involve changing the text, new covers, resubmitting them, so that I can maintain a single ""identity"" (which is my preference)... but that's a *LOT* of work.

Or, I could leave it all as-is and link and refer to those old works anyway -- lots of writers have pen names from other genders as it is. This would just be that. But that's not my preference.

What would be downsides I'm likely missing to going back and republishing my past works with my current (pen)name?

NOTE: I'm not worried about confusing my audience, as let's be honest, I don't really HAVE one! (Yet!)

One complication I see is having some stories that can be found published in printed anthologies with the old name, and also existing singularly under the new name. How much of an issue is that?

Author Testimony] Amazon removed me from their platform. Here’s the truth.,"Author Testimony] Amazon removed me from their platform. Here’s the truth.

One year ago, I published a novel that meant the world to me: title

The day after it went live, I noticed a mistake on the cover:
My author name was misspelled — “author” instead of “author”.

I immediately unpublished the incorrect version.
Then I corrected the cover and republished the book properly, under my real name.
The error was fixed in less than 24 hours.

Since then?

I’ve continued publishing other novels regularly.
My account was active, stable, without any warnings.

Until July 24, 2025, when Amazon suddenly terminated my KDP account, accusing me of copyright infringement.

They claim I copied existing content.

But that content… was mine.
Published by me. A year ago.

I am convinced that the old, incorrect version—though unpublished—remained somewhere in their system and triggered a false violation.

I submitted every proof I could: – Canva screenshots showing the original cover was created a year ago
– My publishing history
– The original manuscript

And yet, no real answer. Just: “Decision upheld.”

I’m an honest writer.
I put my time, my energy, my love, my nights into creating stories that matter to me.
And now I’m being punished for something I didn’t do.

Today, I refuse to stay silent.

If you’re a writer, know that this could happen to you too.
If you follow my work, know that I’m still writing.
And I will publish elsewhere if I have to.

Thank you to everyone who reads, shares, or speaks up.
I will not give up.

Please spread the word. 🙏

Use New Zealand ISBNs for free or pay an exorbinate amount for American ISBNs?,"Hello,

  
I'm excited to publish several books that I've spent YEARS working on. Needless to say these books are important to me.

But I am poor.. very poor after back to back health emergencies over the last two years.

Long story short.. I resided in New Zealand in the past and registered a publisher about 15 years ago. I'm still able to get ISBNs for free (they just sent me 100 more).

Potentially the only Bowker branded ISBN package I might be able to avoid and that makes sense would be the 100 pack but damn $600 is still A LOT of money right now for me. That's honestly almost 2 months of my daily living expenses in Asia. Because my income is extremely limited so I don't have a lot to spare. It sucks. I just want to publsh my books across all platforms with one single ISBN to save time and confusion.

I'm definitely leaning toward using the free New Zealand ISBNs. I'm looking at the ISBNs right now.

  
My place of legal residence is the United States although I'm also overseas most of the time with my partner and kids in Asia. Daily costs here are 10 - 20x cheaper than U.S so I'm able to survive.

Anyways, I'm trying to decide if I should use these New Zealand ISBNs that I get for free to publish my books. I know from ChatGPT and Googling that there would be perhaps some potential ""weirdness"" when I try to market the books or try to publish them on all platforms. Hard bad would it be though? Please be honest with me.. are the risks exaggerated or are there major potential risks that might impede the ability of my books to be successful or trouble with marketing, etc?

I'm so proud of my books and it sucks I'm dealing with having lost most of my vision over the last year due to health emergencies.. but I just want to publish my books and focus on promoting them. I've spent a week thinking what to do about this ISBN issue. Thanks for any helpful insight! I need to decide soon.",1,1,2025-07-26,nips4sucks,N/A,0.67

The truest writing comes from what you've lived,"My personal take on writing: I believe there shouldn’t be much fiction. 
Many authors master it beautifully, but I wrote the book based on a diary I kept for two years. That was my guide. 
Honestly, writing from lived experience is, in my view, the best thing you can do. Just my opinion.""

Η προσωπική μου άποψη για το γράψιμο: πιστεύω ότι δεν πρέπει να υπάρχει πολλή μυθοπλασία. 
Πολλοί συγγραφείς το καταφέρνουν υπέροχα, αλλά εγώ έγραψα το βιβλιο βασισμένο σε ένα ημερολόγιο που κράτησα για δύο χρόνια. 
Αυτός ήταν ο μπούσουλας μου. Ειλικρινά, το να γράφεις κάτι που έχεις ζήσει είναι, κατά τη γνώμη μου, το καλύτερο που μπορείς να κάνεις. Αποκλειστικά προσωπική μου άποψη.

How can I have more readers for my self published children picture book on Amazon ?,"Hi! I have self published two children’s picture books in kdp and my 3 year old toddler really love them and it is a rewarding outcome for me. 

I really don’t care about the money so I placed the minimum price possible for ebook but I don’t have the energy or time for marketing. If it was possible to promote for free for more than a week I would use that. I just like a lot of people read my book and I would really like to hear you experiences. How long should I wait to see results and if my book is even visible for readers, like not at page 10000 of search😆

Self Editing My Book Before Publishing.

How do I make sure my book reaches its target audience?,"
Hey everyone!
I’m currently working on a novel and I’m starting to think ahead about publishing and marketing. its a slow burn mystery about a girl working at a lighthouse, where the keeper, Vernon, has a dark past tied to a place called the Forge. It’s emotional, character-driven, with themes of guilt, memory, and the weight of childhood trauma. 

  think edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting, “what happened back then and who’s hiding what” kind of vibe. It unravels gradually, but it’s packed with tension, big emotional punches, and some serious whodunnit energy.

My question is: what are the best ways to make sure I actually reach the right readers?
Not just “people who like books,” but the ones who are really into those slow-build, atmospheric mysteries with heart, character focus, and emotional depth.
  I’m not just looking for general marketing advice, but specifically how to position the book and get it in front of readers who already like that kind of vibe.

If you’ve self-published something like this before, how did you connect with your niche audience? Any advice, strategies, or links would be super appreciated!

Would really appreciate any tips or insights! :D ",2,11,2025-07-23,Throw_away_3801,N/A,0.75
Transparency coding for Amazon,"I am in a predicament with Amazon. My KDP book is doing well enough to warrant an offset print run for the paperback. Because I used KDP's barcode, it is in their transparency program. Going forward, transparency codes are required for all books I sell off of that ASIN, a fact I discovered when I arranged shipping to the fulfillment center. No exceptions. The trouble is, I am not in the transparency program so I cannot order the transparency codes to place on my offset printed books. The only way out of this Catch-22 (and retain my ratings) appears to be to get a trademark for my imprint in order to enter Amazon's brand registry so that I can join the transparency program in order to buy the transparency codes to ship to my printer where they digitally print them (or sticker them) onto the books.

Is this suspicious? It seems suspicious...,"So I created a few facebook/instagram ads for my books and a day later I got an email (via the email contact on my author website) from someone asking if my books were on Goodreads.

I told her they were not but directed her to Amazon, etc, and offered to send her a review copy if she wanted to go that route.

Then she responded saying she was interested in a book I did not write, so I replied and told her she was mistaken, apologized, and so on. I told her what kind of books I had available and left it at that. 

She wrote me back saying ""send me a link to your book on Goodreads.""

I found that odd, since (A) I already told her I wasn't on Goodreads, and (B) I never mentioned a single ""book"" for her to want to read.

Her email is her name followed by the word ""services1"" and it's a standard gmail account.

If I still want to release this year I can only give ARC readers about three months to finish the book if I send out ARCs this month (Assuming the book would release end of November- sometime in December).

When you messed up and made your debut novel part of a series: how to promote the second one when it's been four years,"So the basic question is: if you published your debut novel that had a teensy bit of success but then life bit you right afterwards and it's been four years since you've published or done anything, how do you promote your second novel that's a sequel to the first and you're finally in a place in your life you want to get serious about writing? 

So here's the setup: 
My bucket list dream since I was a kid was to publish a book. After many years I finally wrote and finished a book (psychological thriller/sci fi). It was supposed to be a stand alone, but in writing it realized I wanted the story to arc over three books.

Problem number one: don't start with a series. But at the time I was really only doing this for me so didn't think it would be a big deal. Had other people edit, created the book cover myself (I'm in graphic design) and had people edit that, did my research, released on Amazon and Barnes and Noble. Only sold a few copies beyond friends and family but got some good feedback from people wanting to know when the second one was coming out, where the story was going. Enjoyed it so much I thought ""hey, this could be a fun thing"". So I created a website, created author pages on Facebook and goodreads, you name it. Started immediately on the second book (just fyi, when I realized it was going to be a series I named and outlined the arc and storyline to all the books before the first was published). 

Then life said hold my beer (illness, job stuff, moving to another state you name it). But all along the way I had people asking when the second book was coming out. So I did my best to scrape it together. But what I had intended to be released the next year has now taken almost four (it's in beta readers now), I've done Jack nothing with my website or social profile, and I'm faced with SO many questions. Especially because through research I've learned so much since last time, but even the things I've learned to do better have just spawned more questions. 

Can I do ARC readers on a sequel book? (I didn't do any for the first)? 
Should I ""relaunch"" the original one so I can do ARC readers? If I relaunch, do I stay on Amazon and b&n, or go for a wider distribution? Where would I go? There's so many choices and it seems like they've all got just as many good reviews as bad. 
Do I acknowledge the time gap or just move on with the social media like nothing even happened? 

I know it'll be a slog but I'm ""hopefully"" in a place to focus on and resurrect my dreams. I even entered a short story sci fi contest and was in the top five picks which boosted my confidence that I can do it. I will make this happen. I'm just wondering what advice is out there so hopefully I can learn how to turn my career into a Phoenix and not end up as a cold pile of embers again ",4,9,2025-07-19,the_modern_wonderer,Author,0.84

Talk to me like I’m 5.,"I’m new to this group. New to publishing. I’m here because I was ALMOST scammed twice by what I now learned to be vanity publishers who were trying to get money from me after I queried about Amazon self publishing. They were both from two different publishing companies and sent me the exact same sales script via email and pitched me BS via phone call.

What I’m looking for: a step by step explanation about HOW TO self publish a children’s book on Amazon. I’m talking starting from the manuscript, who to outsource editing & design with and how to get it printed. 

Do I just create a manuscript via canva and upload it to Amazon kdp and from there they print a hard/soft cover to whoever orders it? I’m totally ignorant to the process but this is a serious goal of mine that I need to complete. Any input helps.

Seeking Direction on Putting Together My Self-help Workbook to Sell on Amazon.,"Hi all!

I have 80-100 pages of content for a self-help workbook that I want to have put together into a 8 1/2 X 11-ish sized book using my business branding colors and logo so I can sell it to my clients via Amazon.

I'll need to hire some design help, which is probably the easy part.  Or, if there's an IA solution to this - please let me know.  

But the hard part - because I'm clueless - is how I get the book physically put together.  Who/how/where does that happen for self-publishers?

Ultimately, I'll want to sell it as an E-book as well.

Can anyone who has done this point me in the right direction about getting the book physically made?  Thanks!

Should I still query lit agents after I've self published,"Recently self published a book on Amazon KDP and currently writing Book 2.

I'd really like, as im sure most writers would, to be able to focus on the actual writing rather than the admin that comes with publishing. 

Is now an appropriate time to query literary agents after I've already published book 1 or is it a 'too late' kind of situation? I didn't want to delay book 1 releasing through the process of querying, but I do genuinely see the appeal/help an agent would provide when it comes to publication.

Writing tools that actually help with story structure and character development?,"I'm working on my first novel for self-publishing and realizing that just having a blank document isn't enough. I need something that helps me structure the story, track character development, and maintain consistency throughout the book.

I've been using Google Docs because it's free, but I'm spending too much time scrolling through long documents trying to find character details or plot points I mentioned earlier. When I'm writing chapter 15 and need to reference something from chapter 3, it's a nightmare to find.

Character development is another issue. I'll create detailed backstories for my characters but then forget to reference them in the actual writing. Or I'll have a character react in a way that doesn't match their established personality because I forgot their motivations.

Plot threads are getting tangled too. I'll set up a subplot in the early chapters, then completely forget about it until I'm doing my final read-through. By then it's too late to weave it back in naturally.

For self-published authors, what tools do you use to keep everything organized? Something that helps with both the writing process and the story structure without breaking the bank?

Crafting a Book Banner That Respects the Reader: A Visual Reflection from My Historical Novel,"As indie authors, we walk a fine line between storytelling and presentation — especially in public spaces like Reddit, where direct promotion is discouraged (understandably so).

I recently designed a banner for my historical novel set in 11th-century Persia — not to push the book, but to visually capture its mood, themes, and cultural echoes. It was a creative challenge: how do you design something that’s visually rich and emotionally resonant... without it becoming a billboard?

I’d love to open this up for insight and discussion:

• What makes a **book banner feel meaningful** rather than market-y?  
• Have you ever found visual tone influencing your interest in a book?  
• Do you lean toward minimalism, or do you prefer rich symbolism?

I’m sharing the image here not as a promotion, but as a reference point — a quiet experiment in visual storytelling. Grateful for your thoughts, fellow storytellers.

"Create Page Publishing: The $7,500 Scam You Need to Avoid at All Costs","# WARNING: The $7,500 Scam You Need to Avoid at All Costs

This scam will steal your money if you let it. A con artist named Jasos Paul **impersonating** COAS Bookstore in New Mexico tried to trick me into handing over $7,500 for a fake returnability program to fulfill a bogus 2,000-book order. **I lost $7,500** to these fraudsters, and I’m here to make sure YOU don’t make the same mistake.

# I Lost $7,500—Don’t Let This Happen to You

I can’t believe I fell for it. In my excitement to get my book into the hands of readers, I nearly handed over $7,500 to these **scam artists**. But thankfully, I stopped just in time. I verified everything directly with COAS Bookstore. **Turns out, they had no idea who Jasos Paul was**, and they certainly weren’t ordering 2,000 copies of my book. They don’t work like that.

But here’s the scary part: I wasn’t the only one. These scammers are out there targeting other authors, and they’ll use any name or fake email they can to take your hard-earned money. If I hadn’t been suspicious and acted fast, I would have been $7,500 poorer for absolutely nothing.

# A Fake Bookstore Order—Too Good to Be True

It started innocently enough. I received an email from someone calling himself **Jasos Paul**, claiming to be a Marketing Officer at COAS Bookstore in New Mexico. He said they wanted to order 2,000 copies of my book to stock in their store. Of course, I was thrilled. What self-published author wouldn’t be? I pictured my book flying off the shelves.

But then, the scam began to unfold. Jasos told me my book needed to be marked as “**returnable**” through IngramSpark for COAS to process the order. Okay, fine. That part sounded reasonable enough—**until he demanded I pay him $7,500 upfront** to make this happen. He claimed it was a standard procedure so that COAS could return unsold copies.

No legitimate bookstore, let alone COAS, is going to force you to pay thousands of dollars to make a book returnable. Real bookstores simply make a returnable arrangement directly through their distributor, not by scamming authors for massive upfront fees.

# The Fake ""IngramSpark Representative"" Scam

Instead of sending me to **IngramSpark’s official website**, Jasos pushed me to contact Dennis Park at a Gmail address (yes, Gmail). Dennis, he claimed, was an IngramSpark rep who would help me make my book returnable. Dennis then tried to tell me I had to work through a shady third-party company called **Create Page Publishing** to get some certificate to prove my book’s returnability. Of course, I’d have to pay them $7,500 for the privilege. That was the moment I knew this whole thing was a scam.

Here’s the kicker: I was conned out of $7,500, all for something IngramSpark doesn’t even charge for. The whole scam was based on a lie: a fake service, a fake certificate, and fake people trying to rob me blind.

**How I Got Scammed—And How I Got My Money Back**

I **fell for it**. I got charged **$7,500** through a PayPal invoice that was sent by these fraudsters. At the time, I didn’t question it and assumed I was moving forward with a legitimate transaction. **But then my gut kicked in**. Something didn’t feel right, so I immediately called my bank and tagged the payment as **fraudulent**. After disputing the charge, I was able to get my money back.

# The Red Flags Were Everywhere

This scam was so blatantly obvious, but when you’re caught up in the excitement, it’s easy to overlook the warning signs. Here's what I should have caught right away, and what every author needs to watch out for:

* **The Fake Email Addresses:** Dennis Park, who was supposedly from IngramSpark, was using a Gmail account. Let that sink in: a “professional” book service using Gmail for business? That’s an instant scam alert.
* **The “Urgency” Tactic:** They kept pressuring me to act fast—a classic scam move. If someone is pushing you to make a quick decision about something as serious as $7,500, don’t walk, RUN.
* **The Fake Website:** I checked the website of Create Page Publishing—it was brand new. It was registered in **July 2025**. A publishing company claiming to be established and yet with a brand new website? Are you kidding me? That’s like saying you have a store with no products.

https://preview.redd.it/lye59liq2pbf1.png?width=2468&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd2ebf975c4d5e8e01c538c8b36f38e138c6d961

* **The Changing Contacts and Vague Details**: The emails kept bouncing between Jasos, Dennis, and a third party. Legit businesses don’t pass you between people with vague details. They connect you directly with the proper channels, not a bunch of faceless strangers.
* The Big “Order” and the Demand for Payment: **A fake bulk order of 2,000 books,** all hinged on paying thousands for a service that didn’t exist. This is textbook scam behavior, designed to get you excited and then pressure you into handing over your money. Real bookstores don’t need you to pay for returnability certificates.

# Red Flags You Must Know to Protect Yourself

* No Legit Publisher Will Demand Upfront Payment: There is no reason a real bookstore will demand you pay anything upfront to make your book returnable. None. Don’t fall for it.
* Scammers Use Free Emails: No serious publisher or distributor uses Gmail or any free email address. If you get an email from a “publisher” or “marketing officer” with a Gmail or Yahoo address, delete it immediately.
* Pressure to Act Quickly Is a Dead Giveaway: If someone pressures you into making a decision in hours or days about something as significant as a $7,500 payment, run. No legitimate business works this way.
* Fake Websites and New Companies: Look up the company’s domain. If it’s newly registered or doesn’t have a long history, it’s probably a scam. Scammers are not trying to build a legitimate business—they want your money, fast.

# Don’t Let This Happen to You

This is a warning to all authors, especially those just starting out. Do not fall for these scammers. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

If anyone ever tries to sell you a returnability certificate or demands money upfront for some other “service”—it’s a scam. Don’t make the same mistake I did. I’m lucky I caught it in time, but I lost $7,500 to these predators. Don’t be the next victim. STAY FAR AWAY from Jasos Paul, Dennis Park, and Create Page Publishing.

If you see these names, or any email that looks even remotely suspicious, report it immediately and warn others. We need to stick together to protect ourselves from these criminals. Don’t let them steal your dream—or your money.",12,6,2025-07-08,Cheap_Holiday6935,N/A,0.83

"Have a finished children's book, THOUGHT I had a self-publisher picked...","I have my first children's book ready: story, illustrations, cover, (getting) copyright. Yay me!

Self published and needing advice on how to gain more visibility,"Hi all!

I've recently self-published my first book, which sat on my hard drive for many years before my wife convinced me it was worth while putting out into the world. The issue I have is that I don't have a lot of visibility on it with only a handful sold since its release.

I've done all the posting on Instagram and Facebook, participated in NetGalley which runs until later on this month, as well as agreed around 40 ARCs. I've had 7 reviews on Goodreads (4.71 avg) and 2 on Amazon (4.5 avg) so far, with more to come I hope. It's worthwhile saying that it came out on the 4th July.

Should a novel like this be divided into two parts?,"So although my novel isn't realy fully finished per say, I have it completely mapped out. It's a semi biographical piece that's like... really heavy I suppose to say the least, very comlex dynamics and all. Let's not get into that.

But chapter 2 is 17000+ words, and by chapter 4 we are crossing 60000 words. By the end of this entire novel, my rough estimate would be approximately 200000+ words, as a debut author, I was curious about this one thing. This entire piece is going to take at the very least 2 years to fully write and polish for publishing, so, would it be best if I were to just publish it in 2 seperate parts? 

Or should I keep grinding until I completely finish it?

What helped me stay consistent after 3 failed book starts (and how I’m trying to help others too),"I’ve tried to write a book three times now — and every time I hit that wall:  
Loss of motivation, doubt, and not knowing how to structure or finish.

So instead of letting the fourth attempt be the same, I spent the last few months researching:

* How to build real consistency
* How other self-published authors structure their work
* How to market and actually *sell* a finished book
* And how mindset and daily habits affect output

That rabbit hole helped me develop a framework that’s keeping me on track now.

Since then, I’ve connected with a few other writers who’ve felt the same — so we decided to create a small, focused space where we help each other stay accountable, share knowledge, and finish what we start.

 It’s completely free right now because we’re building it up and want real feedback.  
If you’ve been stuck or need something to keep you going, **DM me** and I’ll send you an invite.

I Just Hit Publish on My First Book — Here’s What I Learned (and What I’d Do Differently),"I finally pulled the trigger and published my first non-fiction book this week after months of research, outlining, and tweaking my workflow. It's aimed at helping people navigate online income and digital entrepreneurship in 2025 (based on tools, trends, and platforms I've personally tested).

Here are a few things I learned along the way that might help others here:

Keep your outline simple but sharp. I tried to overcomplicate my chapters at first. A tight, clear outline helped me write faster and stay focused.

KDP formatting was easier than expected with tools like Atticus and Canva for the cover. No need to overthink it.

Free launch strategy: I opted to make the book free for the first few days to generate downloads and (hopefully) reviews. We'll see how that goes.

Lesson learned: I wish I’d built a reader email list before publishing. Now I'm scrambling to backfill that piece.

To self-publish (or not) an art book,"With money from my school, I am working on a project that will cumulate in a sort of art book masquerading as a reference guide. The important part of the book will be my detailed watercolor illustrations, accompanied by text about the photos. I am curious about options for getting it turned into a somewhat distributable copy. 

Some things I'm pretty set on is hard cover, thick matte paper, and relatively small size (5 x 8 in). These are expensive selections, I realize, but I really want it to feel like a hand held artifact. Because of the interaction between detailed photos and matte paper, I'm not sure services like Blurb will allow that. It might be necessary to do it myself on an InkJet, which is probably not reasonable for many copies but would be nice to have for a few. Does anyone have any experience turning high-quality giclee or comparable prints into books? Or, even better, know of any services that can do this?

Publishing My First Book via LTD (UK) – Need Guidance on Copyright & Setup Steps,"Hi everyone,

I’d really appreciate your help with a major concern I’m facing before setting up my Limited Company in the UK.

I’ve just completed my first children’s book, which I plan to publish through platforms like KDP. I’ve made a firm decision to publish it via a **Limited Company**, not as a sole trader, for various long-term benefits—so I kindly ask that suggestions to go the sole trader route be avoided.

That said, I haven’t formed the company yet, and I want to make sure I get everything right from the start.

**My main concern is about assigning the copyright of my book to the company.**  
Since I wrote the book before forming the company, I understand that I’ll need to transfer the copyright from myself to the company. However, I’ve come across several warnings that HMRC may treat this transfer as a taxable event, requiring a market valuation and potentially triggering income tax.

These two articles explain the issue in detail:

* AuthorTax: Tax Implications on Transferring Copyrights
* HW Fisher: The Author’s Tax Trap

I’d love to hear from anyone who has dealt with this situation:

* How did you handle the copyright transfer?
* Were you able to do it in a tax-efficient or legally safe way?
* Did you involve an accountant or IP lawyer?

Also, when forming the company, is it sufficient to list the business activity as “Book Publishing”? Are there any other steps I should take to ensure the company is properly set up for publishing and selling books?

**Summary of My Planned Steps:**

1. I’ve written the book – currently under my personal name.
2. I will form a Limited Company (not a sole trader).
3. Before publishing or earning any income, I want to legally transfer the copyright to the company – this is my biggest concern.
4. Once the copyright is assigned, I’ll begin publishing and selling the book.

Rate my writing pls 🙏,"We were recently tasked by our English teacher to write a short story about anything. And since I loved reading, I tried to give it a shot. I read Stephen King and loved it so I tried to make a prologue first to pass it to my English teacher and she recommended that I should pursue writing. I don't know if it's out of bias or anything just because I am one of the school's representatives when it comes to journalism, but she also said that when she put my writing in AI detectors, it said it involved AI, and so did my previous works, even those done with my coach beside me without my phone, but I did not use one. So I'm here trying to get bias free, fresh opinions 🙏. 

P.S. I'm just a high school student (9th grade), and I will honestly take any criticism. 

My prologue was inspired by Stephen King's ""It"" I just took idea for the first paragraph. (Mystery) 

The chaos—which began today, thirteen hours later, and also three years from today, and perhaps on a dozen other days I can no longer separate—started and ended, in a way I still can’t fully comprehend or explain, on the same July night. Or maybe it never ended at all.

It seemed to begin, or perhaps to finish, with a single, absurd image: a battered man in his late thirties or early forties—foreign, yet in some way familiar, though I could never have said from where—lying sprawled in a garbage bin between a bakery and an abandoned complex, one hand dangling limply near the rim, the other buried within the rest of the refuse as if he were searching for something down there in the dark.

I didn’t know him, nor did he know me. But at the same time I did—we did. He looked like a stranger, but there was something in the tilt of his head and the raw desperation in his facial features that made me feel, with a certainty I still can’t explain, that I had known him all my life. Perhaps because, in some unspeakable way, I was already inside him, looking out through his eyes.


He wore all black from throat to toes—a trench coat, shirt, pants, shoes—clothes that seemed built for movement, built to vanish, flexible and agile enough to disappear into any shadow. Clothes you’d expect from a man who lived in the dark and crept down hallways without anyone noticing. Maybe he was a hitman. Or a spy. Or some federal agent on a mission so secret it never made the news.

The way he was positioned inside the bin was peculiar, almost deliberate. It was as though someone had pushed him from a high place—or perhaps he had fallen himself. But from where? Whether he’d climbed in there on his own or been hurled from some height no sane man had ever mapped, I would never know.

I wish I could’ve told you that he was alive when I saw him. But he wasn’t. He had just died, about ten minutes ago or longer. The blood and his body had started to cool. And the street had begun to smell like old, rusty iron.

Then the bell tower rang once—a single, flat, cold note carrying through the night air, cracking the profound stillness that had settled over the block.

One o’clock midnight. I knew that. And yet—just for a moment—I felt certain I had heard thirteen.

Thirteen.

The hour struck, not merely a chime but a singular, brutal declaration against the quiet; again, that accursed number, its repetition a subtle, unsettling tremor beneath the surface of his consciousness.

Maybe it was only him who heard it—maybe only me. I could no longer tell where his fear ended and mine began.

The July night had descended upon him hours earlier, bringing with it a cold that seemed to pierce the very marrow—a darkness that felt less like an absence of light and more like a palpable, crushing presence.

Limp and desperate, the body of a man—less a man now than a ragged silhouette moving through the indifferent dark—pushed itself forward with the frail obstinacy of something too stubborn to die cleanly. Each strained step was a negotiation with the terrible machinery of pain grinding in his joints, a frantic, ill-fated bid to flee the very scene of his catastrophic failure: a personal apocalypse that had shattered his meticulously constructed, utopia-like world.

Each ragged inhalation tasted of blood and rain-slick asphalt, an unholy blend that made him gag even as he fought to stay conscious—a fleeting shadow staggering through the night as though already halfway into the grave.

It had all unraveled so quickly. The intended victim had slipped through his desperate grasp like grains of sand, impossibly fine and unyielding, scattering through his fingers. It—no, they—vanished into the shadows, as if the night itself had conjured them and reclaimed them in that irreversible instant.

And with a clarity that struck like a blow, he understood with a sick certainty that the predator had become the quarry: the hunter, reduced to a bleeding fool sprawled on the unforgiving pavement.

Blood.

It was everywhere, a grotesque, glistening lacquer upon his skin, yet it was not merely external; it was his own blood. It gleamed on his hands, pooled inside the hollow of his throat, filled its coppery tang into his nostrils, seeped into the threads of the black coat he’d once imagined made him look so efficient. Every pulse behind his heart was an accusation—You failed, you failed, you failed—beating in time with the slowing rhythm of his blood.

All he could perceive through the haze of pain and despair was red—a primal, visceral hue. Through the pulsing crimson haze he saw them again: the eyes of that mysterious entity, burning and inhuman. A presence, he reasoned, that seemed sent from the infernal depths—a raw, ancient malevolence that had somehow, inexplicably, broken through the shackles meant to prohibit it from ever wreaking havoc upon this mundane world.

His legs buckled. They folded like wet paper. They sent him sprawling—a broken ragdoll—onto the cold, unforgiving ground. The rough texture of the grit-scarred asphalt bit into his raw flesh.

The agony was instant and bright—a sharp, lancing fire that tore through his body—but it paled against the deeper wound inside him, a wound that bled shame more than blood.

Yet even that was merely a whisper, a fleeting prickling when held against the deafening roar of failures and lost opportunities reverberating through the very chambers of his skull.

His vision, already blurred by pain, tightened into a narrowing tunnel. The world pressed in around him, heavy as a crypt. There was no discernible light—only that thick, tenebrous darkness, so complete it felt alive, a suffocating void as black as that fateful night that had birthed his torment, a darkness that wanted to crawl down his throat and fill him until there was nothing left to feel.

Memories surfaced, unwanted as corpses floating up from a lake’s bottom—pale and decaying—clawing their agonizing way out of the abyss of his submerged consciousness. Faces he had failed. Names he could no longer say aloud without tasting iron. He saw himself, too: some lifeless form of a man, features tragically still, a stark tableau of despair, his stories untold, his very existence brutally truncated. Years—a meaningless procession—had bled into nothingness. His entire existence, he realized with a chilling clarity, had left no mark, no legacy, no testament to a life lived. A man whose story had ended before it was ever worth the telling.

He stood, precariously balanced, at the crossroads of identity, the very core of his being dissolving into a terrifying question—one that would not release him:

Who was he, in this desolate, final hour?

His thoughts came ragged and sharp, like teeth tearing at his prefrontal cortex—a relentless, frantic machine racing with questions, each one a desperate, clawing tendril reaching for some scrap of understanding.

“Was he truly Dr. Steven Smith, that man of accomplishments, a lauded figure whose very name once resonated with professional authority? Or was he now merely a stripped-bare husk, devoid of every accolade, every achievement, every vestige of his former self? And in this terrifying duality, was he merely a vessel for me—this narrative consciousness observing his agony—or am I, in some profound, terrifying way, nothing more than a vessel for him, a manifestation of his fragmented self?”

The memories of his past life—those once solid anchors in the storm—had grown brittle as old bones, rattling in the dark like distant, mocking voices. The border between what he had been and what he was softened, bleeding like ink into water, until he could no longer tell one from the other, each recollection dissolving into a spectral whisper barely audible over the frantic drumbeat of his failing heart.

The fine line between who he was and who I am blurred, irrevocably, like water bleeding on paper; dissolving all distinction, merging two lines, two identities into a single, terrifying, unknowable form.

The darkness was not merely a metaphor for his inevitable demise. It was real. Total. He was dying—indeed, that was certain. It was suffocating. It pushed against his ribs with a slow, relentless pressure—a tangible, physical weight upon his chest, as if the cold air mingling in the tenebrous night were determined to squeeze out the last breath from his lungs.

The cold ground beneath him—that hard, indifferent surface—felt precisely like the embrace of death itself. A stark, brutal contrast to the fleeting warmth of life he had once, so casually, known.

As the sharp, biting stings of regret slowly and mercifully abated, the shadows continued to envelop him, a slow, relentless tide, suffocating his helpless body with a chilling certainty.

He tried, with a last, pathetic surge of strength, to rise—to push himself up from the mire of blood and rainwater collecting around his ribs. For an instant, he thought he might manage it. But the illusion dissolved almost before it formed. His arms trembled, then buckled. Not merely from fatigue—though there was plenty of that—but because the pavement had turned to a slick sheet beneath him, the rain mingling with his blood into something dark and viscous.

He hadn’t even realized it was raining. He hadn’t heard the first drops ticking against his coat, hadn’t felt the cold water soaking the fabric until it clung to him like a funeral shroud. And neither did I, at the time. Only now, as he collapsed again, did the downpour announce itself in earnest: a drumming that matched the last, feeble beat of his heart. In that dull, pulsing percussion, he thought—God help him—it sounded almost like applause, as if the rain itself had come to celebrate his collapse.

The world around him, once a landscape of vibrant hues, now grew utterly dim. The pervasive darkness swallowed his entire line of sight, consuming the last flickering images as his consciousness slipped away—like candles snuffed by a sudden gust.

But then, from that profound, encompassing darkness, even as his last thought guttered out, a solitary, terrifying truth emerged: a fleeting, deceptive beacon in the night sky, shimmering with an insidious, false hope.

“He should have written a diary, as I did, for you to come back to me, to end this cycle.”

Yet, that glimmer of light was short-lived, a brief, mocking flicker. As the implacable darkness persisted, absolute and final, he drew his ultimate, chilling conclusion, a thought solidified in the very instant before the encroaching void.

For a moment, he lay suspended—his body sprawled in a grotesque tableau of blood and rain, pinned between what he had been and whatever waited on the other side. The thunder cracked overhead, sudden and violent, and in that split-second roar he remembered exactly how it had felt: the crowbar arcing down in the stranger’s left hand, striking the right side of his skull just above the ear—where the temporal bone thins and the fragile tissue of the right temporal lobe pulses, pink and secret.

A dull, bright pain had exploded behind his eye, and for a heartbeat he had known nothing—no name, no mission, no self. He tried to summon rage or even fear, but all that came was a kind of grim wonder. Was this all it took to erase a man? One steel arc and a single wet impact? He lay there listening to the rain rattle against the street lamp he hadn’t even noticed, the glass trembling like a dying star, not knowing if the world had ended or merely contracted to the size of the alley that had birthed our torment.

As the moonlight—a sudden, piercing blade—cut through the shroud of clouds, he clung with a desperate, failing grip to the last vestiges of reality. His thoughts, once a chaotic maelstrom, crystallized with agonizing clarity just before death—cold and inevitable—finally claimed him.

After being lost in the labyrinth of his own shattered mind, in that moment of ultimate clarity, he knew, with a terrifying certainty, that he was—

.

In an instant, everything changed, with a brutal, visceral immediacy; it was no longer dark, but bright, blindingly so, as searingly bright as that fateful day that had irrevocably altered the trajectory of his very existence.

The light, however, was not merely a physical presence, a simple phenomenon of photons assaulting the retina; it was something more, something profound. It was hope—his hope, a blinding, desperate beacon guiding him towards a new, terrifying understanding of himself, a revelation that transcended mere illumination.

He died, alone in solitude, the cold asphalt pavement gnawing deep into his skin as its rough texture drank his crimson blood as if it had been waiting for it all night long. If he had not been struck by that damn steel crowbar, perhaps he would have survived—and possibly completed the mission he came here to do. Yet to his surprise, even with a second chance at life, he would have never known that there were two of them. Two.

The chaos—which began today, or three years ago, or perhaps right now—has never really ended. Perhaps it was always me watching him die, or him watching me.

And now that he is gone, where am I to go now? This mere narrative body whose sole purpose was to serve as his vessel—but now, whose vessel am I?

It is for him.

. . . Who is he?

The rollercoaster of being an indie author,"I wanted to share some thoughts and experiences from my journey as an indie author. It’s been a mix of exhilarating highs and daunting lows, but every step has been a learning opportunity.

The Freedom: Being in control of my creative process is liberating. I set my own deadlines, choose my cover art, and decide how to market my books. There’s no gatekeeper, just me and my passion.

The Challenges: It’s not all sunshine, though. Self-promotion can be overwhelming. Navigating algorithms, building a readership, and handling critiques without a publisher’s backing is tough.

The Community: The indie author community is incredibly supportive. Sharing tips, offering feedback, and celebrating each other’s successes make the journey less lonely.

My Takeaway: Consistency is key. Writing regularly, engaging with readers, and being open to feedback have been game changers.

To anyone considering this path: It’s demanding but incredibly rewarding. Keep writing, keep learning, and don’t be afraid to put your work out there.

Fellow indies, what’s your experience been like? Any tips or stories to share?",5,1,2025-07-01,DLHadley,N/A,0.86
I thought I was making progress with Kindle Unlimited… until I saw what I actually earned,"I’m an indie author and recently published a book through KDP. I decided to enroll it in Kindle Unlimited because it sounded like a solid way to reach more readers. The idea of getting paid per page read seemed fair at first, until I looked closer.

That’s when things stopped adding up.

I wasn’t getting paid for downloads, just for how many pages someone supposedly read. But I had no way to see who read the book, how far they got, or even when they opened it. Just a number. No timestamps, no reader insight, no transparency. If someone re-reads the book later, I get nothing for that. If they skim or stop, that’s all I’m paid for.

And the rate per page? It changes every month. I couldn’t forecast anything. Couldn’t tell what I’d done right or wrong. It felt like trying to build a business blindfolded.

I realized I couldn’t even connect with the people reading my work. There’s no way to follow up, say thank you, or build a relationship with your audience. You’re locked into their system with no visibility and no control.

Just curious, has anyone else here felt that disconnect with KU? Or felt like the royalty system keeps you guessing rather than growing?

***UPDATE*** After 2 months of my book being out and seeing some royalties come in it's terrible. For 242 pages read I get paid .86 cents. That's 2 book checked out, 1 completely read and and the other more than half read. Meanwhile even if I sell my book I get 70% royalties. In my opinion not worth it and my other published books are not on KU. ",95,95,2025-06-30,CannaChefBuz,N/A,0.88

Writer Beware? Promoter Hoax with Fake Accounts?,"Hello,

The purpose of this post is to verify if some social media user is pushing a promotion scam. If my suspicions are correct, I hope that this post can possibly warn another author if they are put into the same scenario.

A small caveat: I don't use social media. I only made such accounts in case they would help my book. I did grow up during an age of the internet where blatant scams were everywhere, so I'm at least grateful for that. If this is a very common scam, then at least I learned something today.

I'm quite green to the self-publishing world. While I managed fumble through and self-publish a book. I'm out of my depth when it comes to marketing. I've been spinning my wheels for a year to yield next to no results in comparison to the time investment in. However, this week,  I was messaged by an unverified user on X. He presented himself as Michael Wallace (@MichaelWal22229), author of Crow Hollow (2015) and The Red Rooster (2011). He claimed that he was trying to help indie authors get effective promotions through a company called Write2Win Promotion. He gave me an e-mail address to contact them.

Red flags immediately popped up, but a verified writer (Cody Pelletier,  @ Publishquest) followed them. From a combination of boredom, desperation, and curiosity, I e-mailed the address and bombarded them with questions, not giving any personal info all the while. They had a whole sales pitch and ended up with sending information for a wire transfer for their services. The information did not match the asserted name of the person I was supposedly talking to.

I can't find any trace of them outside of apparently a Facebook page, as I can't find any testimonials, references, or mention of them in any forums or subreddits. I contacted the named individuals through their posted official channels posted on Goodreads to prove that I wasn't talking to them and to inform them that people are using their names/status to scam aspiring authors.

  
This appears to be a blatant scam, but I found no mention of it anywhere. Barring the extremely unlikely chance that an accomplished, yet unverified, author decided to contact a literal nobody, this will be a good warning to those who may get contacted in the future.

  
If there are other, more common scams, please inform me so that I don't burn time by investigating.",0,5,2025-06-20,Icarus_Kote,N/A,0.33
children's book,"I'm an early years teacher with an art degree, I've written and currently illustrating my own children's book. How do I go about self publishing? How does it all work? ",5,3,2025-06-19,bumblebee884,N/A,1.0
Is it ever too late to self publish?,"What I'm curious about is, say I do queries to get trad published. Send out an X number, and don't hear/get rejected from those in 6-ish months. Would it be okay to self publish at that point?

Or, say I query, get an agent, we edit and do all the things and... the book dies on sub. Is it okay to self publish at this point?

In general, is there ever a point along the Start Querying --> Get Trad Published process, in which it becomes obvious the book will not be picked up, that it is no longer okay to self publish instead?

For context I currently have a finished manuscript that has gone through alpha readers (a discord of writers/readers of the same genre with mostly positive feedback). I will be doing a run of developmental edits based on that feedback before doing a beta reading run. Although I would like to try for trad publishing the current manuscript is sitting at 135k, and though I think I can shave off 5k-ish with some refining, its going to get filled back up again with some of the stuff I need to add. The story itself is a fantasy romance with a mystery/legal drama plot and a lot of mental health discussion. A lot is addressed, it needs time and verbiage. For what it is, I feel like I already condensed and streamlined it a lot. So its a little niche, and probably hard to market. (Though I am attempting to do some self advertising on the side)

All that is to say, unless I commit to really getting down those last 15k words -- and I am unsure I want to as I think at this point it will be to the detriment of the story -- I'm going into querying as a ""I want to send some out to get a feel for them, but I am not expecting much."" But that led to the question, if I do try and get some traction but it falls through somewhere further down the line, would I just be shooting my self in the foot if I attempt to self publish after?",3,20,2025-06-18,TheLadyAmaranth,N/A,0.67

Someone released their own version of my free ebook,"I've been a self published author for the last two years, releasing a 4-part series through Draft 2 Digital. The first book is free, the rest at small price. 

I have found on Amazon an imposter version of my free ebook has been listed at a price. It has a different ASIN to mine and no ISBN (mine has one). It has a completely different cover design. It is listed for around £2. But the listing is linked to my author profile and the remainder of my series. 

I'm at a loss as to how this has happened (and who would do this, considering I'm an unknown author and this is absolutely not a money maker). 

I don't know how to flag it either, as I'm not an Amazon author. 

This coincided with finding two listings on Etsy of my book (laughably trying to sell it for £8). 

All this started after I listed on a free ebook site. I feel they've put out a digital downloaded copy and someone's happily reproducing it to sell on.

"New Publisher, what are my steps and the best ways to tackle them?","I've been writing for years and now I finally want to publish something (writing is a passion of mine and I plan on turning it into a career one day, but also the job market sucks and I could really use the money right now).

I know enough that I need to find an illustrator so that I can self-publish on Amazon, and that's where my questions come in.

1) Where's a reliable source to find someone? 

A lot of illustrator sites I find are targeted towards Children's books, and that's not the kind I'm writing. Picture books to be sure, but the topics are just a little too heavy to be considered for children. Meanwhile sites that are not dedicated to Children's books don't seem as professional and that makes me worry they may not be as trustworthy, so I just wanted to get the people's opinions.

2) What then?

What's the process of submitting a book on Amazon? How do I submit it with the illustrated version? Does the illustrator send me a complete version or does that depend on the person?

Before anyone says it, I know answers can be found on Google, but it's hard to find something that's more than just partially helpful or two sources that don't contradict each other.

"UK based new children’s book author - looking for advice on the best print on demand hardback book printers, please","Hello. As the titles says, I’m a first time author of a 28 page fully colour-illustrated children‘s book. I have set up an account with KDP for the ebook and paperback editions. However, I’d like to set up an option for a hardcover version. 

I’ve looked at a variety of printers and many of them have a minimum page count of 32 pages. I’ve looked at Lulu who have very lightweight paper options which I don’t believe would be suitable for full colour prints. 

Ideally I’d like to set up an option that prints a book at the point of order. Rather than preorder in bulk and post them myself. (Although I am not opposed to that if there’s no other solution). Unfortunately, that route also requires a large bulk order to make the price of each book profitable, with a significant financial outlay up front. 

As mentioned, I’m in the U.K. so printing and distribution would ideally be done nationally, with international distribution as an addition via the printers if that were to ever occur. (Unlikely, I know!! Haha)

Does anyone have any recommendations for printers that can print and deliver on demand hardback books? Thank you.

Question on word count for my first book!,"So I am writing a series of young adult horror books. I have an overarching story I wanted to tell in a span of 12 books total but I wanted to make each book a shorter 130/150 page read that people could binge through. Each book tells a complete story in itself but nicely sets up the next book in the series. 

My question is this, 

While getting opinions someone told me I should aim for a 50,000 word count so that my books could be considered Novels. I’m a first time publisher and never even thought about that. My first book is completed at right over 35,000 words. Like I said before, shorter bingeable series. Should I expand on the story to hit that 50,000 word mark?

I’ve lost my passion for writing,"I've been self published since 2023. I published 4 books that year. I started experiencing depression because I was comparing myself to other writers who were more successful than me. They had more reviews. Their books were constantly being recommended and in reader groups. They were bestsellers.

I started wondering what was wrong with me, feeling like I suck, that if I were better I'd be more popular.

Before I started publishing, I didn't care who read my books. I told myself I loved writing so much that even if I never made any money I'd still write.

Publishing changed that.

In 2024, I published the final 2 books in a six book series. I'd realized that my first series wasn't to market so I tried to correct that. I wrote a dark romance duet and packed it full of tropes I'd observed from in the genre.

It was a big success. I think. A lot of people loved it. But it didn't give me the boost I'd hoped it would. I started spiraling.

I've been unable to finish anything I write since august 2024. I was on a roll toward the end of 2023, writing two books very quickly and having lots of fun doing it because I believed these books were finally going in the right direction.

And they are, but I'm constantly comparing myself to others and downplaying my accomplishments. My newest release was #2 in its category--because it's an easy category to rank in, and it wasn't even good enough to hit number 1 bestseller.

That's how my brain works. Downplaying. Moving the goalposts. Comparing. Criticizing.

Just stop thinking no that way. Yeah. Wish it were that simple. 

I've been taking antidepressants (Wellbutrin and Zoloft) but they aren't helping. This depression keeps coming back. I keep worrying people will hate my books, feeling like something is off with my writing, I have no enthusiasm or passion for any of my projects.

I'm not the same person I was before I started publishing and I don't know how to get her back.

It's so stupid that I feel this way. I'm sure other authors would love to be in my position. I don't make tons of money (lucky to make over 300 a month) but I'm selling. I have a small, quiet reader group with a few fans. People like my books.

So why isn't that enough? 

When will I finally feel good enough?

Here’s the article if you haven’t seen it 👇:

https://www.latintimes.com/fantasy-author-called-out-using-ai-after-leaving-prompt-published-book-so-embarrassing-583727

My take... Honestly? Stuff like this sets all of us back.

Imagine putting your heart and soul into a book. Pouring time, emotion, energy into building every scene and setting up the right phase.. then struggling to be taken seriously because a few people out there are uploading half-baked AI outputs and calling it a day.

What’s worse? I’ve been accused of using AI too 🔥 just because I use em-dashes, have a few alignment quirks, or write in short sentences. No proof. Just instant skepticism and (in my case) someone who got weirdly obsessive about it.

So now I’m wondering... how do you all feel about this?

Is this just the beginning of a trust breakdown between writers and readers?
Will it blow over once people learn to tell the difference?
Or are we heading into a messy corner of no return  where real writing gets thrown in with the worst-case scenario examples?

Questions About Companion Books,"Here is the background: About ten years ago, I was looking for work on Upwork and got into contact with a company that writes companion books to go with bestsellers.

Their website is a 404, the people I contacted no longer worked there when I emailed them, etc. The book was never published and the company appears to be out of business.

I haven't thought about it in a while but was reminded of it tonight. I'm trying to decide if it is worth self publishing. The book it's about is quite successful and is also now a TV series.

Best way to add videos to technical books,"Hi writing a book in aerial circus skills. (Mostly a primer on technique) Realistically I need to add videos to make this work. 

Options I can see is add qr codes for the skills to the pages. (Either to a website I maintain or with links to YouTube videos of the skill I produce) 

Or I codify the tricks (duey decimal style) and then maintained a website using these numbers to find and categories tricks. 


Thought are first option work fine and I can leave it and done, but It would become out of date as new stuffs invented ( which happens in this industry's fairly often) or by classifying them with numerical it makes it easier for owners of the book to find techniques that connect to tricks they know and use. Meaning it can be continuously updated without issues, but it might well be harder to navigate for some users making things less user friendly.  Also you tube for hosting videos is an option but not sure of there reliability for keeping videos up over the long term with stable links (if link code changes then book is useless) second us dose anyone know the cost associated with hosting a server and website that host a lot of videos while keeping a reasonable play time for those videos? 

Sorry for the rambling any expreance in this would be useful

GETTING PAID,"I know how to write  I know how to get published. Problem is the self-publishing house gets the money my work produces and does not distribute a cent to me.

"Beware of this company ""Century House Publication""","Aspiring author here.  Won't give you the pitch, if it's good you'll hear about it eventually.  Bottom line, I have been considering taking the self publishing route for my first release.  Still weighing pros and cons.  All that aside, in my excitement to how self publishing can be done properly, I looked for companies that might offer help or insight into the process.  Google offered a sponsored company as top result upon searching ""Companies that help with self publishing""

Name of the company is in the Title ""Century House Publication""

Slick website, lots of promises, immediate and responsive interactive chat, followed by a phone call with a friendly representative who provided out a very enticing pitch.  I was wary, as one should always be, but listened politely and asked some questions.  They were quite receptive and responsive, and then sent me a contract and list of authors that they work with.  The names were all easy to find on Amazon and Apple Books.  I told them I wanted time to think about it.

I reached out directly to the authors referenced in the email, providing a snapshot of the message I'd received with their names highlighted.  I've had one response so far, which was from the literary agency of the author in question.  They said:

  
**She has never self published and we have never heard of this company.**

  
Not shocking, I looked into it for a reason. It sounded too good to be true.  But, they were expert level good at the pitch, and (embarrassingly) I found myself getting excited before the Spidey-Sense kicked in.  

Upon reflection, I should have known immediately without having to verify (as many of you might be thinking) but it's not always easy to be discerning and cynical when we're excited as artists to find an easy path to share our creations.  

So, simply put, beware of this place, and others like it.   

Be well.

Best way to self publish comic and print on demand?,"Hi! Thank younfor reading. I'm a comic book artist and I've made a few comics that I'd like to print and sell.

readers could search and find my comic by name

Print comics on demand and ship them accross the world (I have friends in different countries that would like to buy them)

I could sell in different languages (I'd do the translating myself)

Print in good quality in both black and white and color.

ideally could print and ship in bulk if ever needed.

Discussion:  Self-Editing,"I was recently talking to an author friend and was surprised to hear that she still edits her own work. This surprised me for several reasons-- for one, she is a bestselling author, so she can afford to have someone do this for her. Also, I think there is a commonly held belief that self-editing is an absolute no-no, especially for the self-published, because of the quality issue. A trad published book would never go out without a thorough edit (and proofread).

So-- I thought this might be an interesting discussion. Do you self-edit?  Do you use A.I. to help you edit?  Do you hire an editor, or collaborate with someone (like exchanging editing with another author)?  I write non-fiction and have always employed editors. Recently, though, I tried a method I heard about in a writer's group-- I had my computer read my whole book to me out loud to catch obvious mistakes, then I ran the book through two forms of A.I. (ChatGPT and Claude) chapter by chapter. The result was great and I might never go back!

"How I Published 5 Children’s Books, Sold 60+ Copies Locally, and Started Building a Brand — Without a Huge Budget”","How I Self-Published My Children’s Books and Started Selling (Step-by-Step)

Hey everyone, I thought I’d share a full breakdown of how I published and started selling my children’s books — including publishing, advertising, merch, and building trust with early learning centres. Hopefully this helps anyone who’s thinking of doing the same!

⸻

Step 1: Writing and Polishing the Manuscripts
	•	Wrote and edited my children’s books myself.
	•	Focused on fun, simple stories for kids aged 2–6 years old.
	•	Read them aloud again and again to make sure the rhythm flowed perfectly (this is SO important for kids’ books).

⸻

Step 2: Creating the Illustrations
	•	Used AI-based tools (like DALL-E or Midjourney) to create custom illustration concepts.
	•	Made sure my characters stayed consistent across all pages (e.g., same turtle, same mullet, same eel).
	•	TIP: I kept all my children’s books the same size (8.125 x 8.25 inches) — this meant I could reuse my formatting templates easily for every new book, saving heaps of time and keeping everything professional.
	•	Saved illustrations as high-quality PNGs, ready for upload.

⸻

Step 3: Publishing the Books
	•	Signed up with Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) — completely free and beginner-friendly.
	•	Uploaded my files carefully, double-checked bleed settings, and used their free ISBNs (you can upgrade later if you want more control).
	•	Priced my books with a strong profit margin (aimed for 50%+ profit per book after Amazon’s costs).

⸻

Step 4: Ordering Author Copies
	•	Ordered author copies directly from KDP at printing cost — much cheaper than buying at retail.
	•	Bulk-ordered to save on shipping and have physical stock ready to sell locally.

⸻

Step 5: Advertising and Selling Locally
	•	Designed flyers using Canva (easy and free).
	•	Printed extra flyers through Temu for super cheap bulk quantities.
	•	Created Educator Packs (5 books bundled together) to sell directly to daycare centres and kindergartens.
	•	Walked into local centres, introduced myself, left flyers, and offered a simple, friendly conversation about the books.
	•	Set up a Google Form linked to a QR code on the flyer so educators could place orders easily.

⸻

Step 6: Professional Touches
	•	Created a uniform (simple branded shirts) and wore a professional badge with my name and “Children’s Author.”
	•	Made sure I had my valid Blue Card (Working With Children Check in Australia) — centres feel much more comfortable working with someone who is fully cleared.
	•	Ordered personalised pens from Temu with my book brand name — left them at daycares as freebies for staff to keep (great little brand reminder!).

⸻

Step 7: Tracking Sales and Profits
	•	Set up a basic spreadsheet to track:
	•	How many books I sold
	•	Sale prices
	•	Printing + shipping costs
	•	Profit margins
	•	This made it easy to see when I needed to reorder and which books were most popular.

⸻

Step 8: Expanding with Merch (Budget-Friendly!)
	•	Bought little extras from Temu:
	•	Custom stickers
	•	Bookmarks
	•	Mini tote bags
	•	Bulk-printed flyers and branded pens
	•	These added a professional touch without breaking the bank — and made my packs feel like special gifts rather than just book sales.

⸻

Step 9: Building My Brand Slowly
	•	Focused first on local sales and personal relationships with educators.
	•	Didn’t stress about a website or ads at first — most of my early sales came from real conversations, not online marketing.
	•	Now slowly building a broader brand presence (website, social media, markets, events).

⸻

Biggest Lessons I Learned:
	•	Keep everything consistent — book sizes, branding, and templates. It saves time and looks way more professional.
	•	Show up professional — even if you’re new. Uniforms, badges, flyers, and Blue Card clearance built instant trust with centres.
	•	Start local first — your community is far more supportive than random online buyers at the beginning.
	•	You don’t need a huge budget — smart choices (like Temu merch and Canva designs) go a LONG way.
	•	You learn by doing — don’t wait to be perfect to start!

Now I’m ready to take the next step and prepare this collection for both print-on-demand and ePub distribution. I have several questions about the process:

1. **Cover Design**:
   * What are the recommended **dimensions and resolution** for the front cover image?
   * What is the best **file format** to use (JPG, PNG, PDF)?
   * How do I design for the **spine**—how wide should it be, and what needs to go on it?
   * How should I handle the **back cover**—what content is typically included (bio, summary, barcode, etc.), and is it also submitted as a separate image file?
2. **Combining for Print**:
   * Is the full cover (front, spine, back) usually designed as a single wraparound file?
   * Should this be created in a specific template or format, depending on the page count and trim size?

Haven’t seen the results yet and I’m probably going to check back in on Friday, but wanted to know if anyone else has used a tactic like this, and if they believe that it helped them get more sales for their own series? ",3,4,2025-04-14,JaniGriot,Author,1.0

"Isn't the ""Hire a cover artist"" advice essentially a scam preying on the wishes and dreams of aspiring authors?","I always hear (mainly from cover artists) that a professionally designed cover is *essential* for a Self Published book's success.  Prices to commission a cover seem to range from $100 up. $400 is a price I have seen quoted as average.

Can most SP authors, especially new authors, expect to earn even *that* much on their book?  You spend a year or more writing and refining your manuscript, then spend $100- $400+ on a cover.  Are you even going to recoup that?  Or are you just a sucker who wrote a novel only for some artist to make a buck off of your hopes and dreams?  Everyone wants to think their book will be a best-seller, but few really achieve that.

I look through the lists of SP books on Amazon, and all the professional covers in the various genres seem to blur into one standardized image that caters to the latest marketing trend for that genre.  Cheaper, ""canned"" pre-generated covers are the same.  The only SP covers that really seem to stand out to me are the home-made, author created ones.

Maybe if you are established as an author and have a huge readership following you, paying a pro artist for covers could be justified.  Otherwise, if you are just starting out,  I would sincerely recommend getting familiar with some photo editing software and trying your hand at making your own covers.

Unless you just want to write and publish solely in order to supplement the income of cover artists, of course.",0,42,2025-04-15,LibrarianBarbarian1,N/A,0.36

Determining the Correct Fantasy Subgenre,"I hope this is the right place to post this, but I'm going through the process of self-publishing via Amazon KDP for the first time, and I'm getting a little stuck at which subgenre categories to check off in their list of options for a fantasy novel. I'm not sure how much it actually matters/will impact me either, but none of the subgenre options feel quite right. 

I've always classified my book as a 'science fantasy' novel, which I know *is* a category of the fantasy umbrella genre, but it's not an option on Amazon KDP. My story takes place in the real world and takes a more science-based explanation for all it's unrealistic stuff. The story is about mermaids, which are just a species, albeit a rare and mostly undiscovered one, that loosely follows basic animal kingdom rules. They don't have magic powers, they have to hunt and eat and have a place in the foodchain and such. But the primary focus of my story is using advanced (prolly more sci-fi than fantasy) DNA splicing to transform a human character into a mermaid using the DNA of a previously captured specimen. 

I've always felt it to be a bit of a blend between sci-fi AND fantasy rather than one or the other, hence using the term science fantasy. But there doesn't seem to be a good fit for genre selection on KDP. Does anyone with more experience with the process on KDP have any suggestions on what I should select and how impacting the decision will actually be in the long-run?",1,7,2025-04-08,fantasyocean33,N/A,0.67

Does Amazon publishing send an automatic email?,"Hey so…this may not be a conventional post in here but… 

I’ll try to cut to the chase

So I have received an email from a relative that I haven’t spoken to in years, decades. The email greets me with my name and tells me about the book he just published and that he hopes I like it and adds the link. 

No addressing at all of the elephant in the room. Basically a spam email if I’m honest. 

Now, I see 3 possible scenarios here:

1. He wrote the email to me

2. He copy pasted this automatically generated text and send it to his whole contact list, including me (the nerve!)

3. Amazon publishing services somehow emails your whole contact book on your behalf when you publish something.

Going to quit my job to write. What city should I live in?,"Hi all, I’m planning to quit my job next year to write novels full-time. And I’d like some advice on where to live. This will be my home base. Below are the factors  that I’m keeping in mind while looking for a new city. If you have any recs for places, I’d greatly appreciate it!

1. Money: I’m willing to spend $40K post-tax per year for my total annual expense including everything (housing, insurance, food, transportation, etc.). I will be financially independent, so should be able to support this amount indefinitely into the future. I can spend up to $60K a year, but I’d prefer not to. I am assuming I will not make any money from my publications (just to be conservative with my budgeting.)
2. Improve writing skills: Should I just join some kind of program for creative writing? I’ve been out of school for a longtime though, and never took creative writing classes in college. What are some programs that don’t require letters of recommendation from professors  or formal degree in writing? (I know about Stanford Stegner, but it’s too hard to get in.)
3. Writing community: I’d like to join some in-person communities for writers, or be able to take classes/workshops in person. 
4. Romantic life: I’m in my mid-thirties, and would like to be in a city where I can go on dates / potentially find a long term partner. (I’m a straight woman.)
5. Social life: I like big, cosmopolitan cities where people are open to making new friends. I typically like to live in the quieter part of the city (or maybe right outside of the city), but close enough to socialize with others. 
6. I’m open to living in a different country.
7. I like warm weather, but don’t like extreme humidity or super high temperatures. I like nature and would like to be able to frolic outside.
8. I do not like Boston. Sorry.
9. I like NYC and Shanghai, and have lived in both places. However, NYC feels a little dangerous nowadays, and the public transportation system is bad. Shanghai is great, but I feel there’s probably not enough of a community for writers writing in English.",0,9,2025-04-01,Dizzy_Bend6259,N/A,0.38

Six months of book marketing on a $0 budget,"I launched a sci-fi novella on Amazon early last fall (eBook, KU, and paperback; hardcover added more recently). I'm happy with the steady trickle of activity but want to do more. Sharing my progress here in order to compare notes and solicit ideas!

Results:

eBook downloads: 345 (some free, some paid)

* KU page reads (approx): 2,300
* Paperbacks: 15
* Amazon ratings/reviews: 16 ratings, 5 reviews (4.3 stars avg)
* GoodReads ratings/reviews: 12 ratings, 4 reviews (4.3 stars avg)

What we've tried so far ('we' including my gf, who does most of the heavy lifting):

* Reddit posts: This has been the main marketing channel, and you can see where/what we've posted in my profile. We've mainly given the book away to hope for more paid downloads, with mixed success. A typical series of giveaway posts yields 70 downloads.
* Blog reviews/guests posts: We've submitted to dozens of blogs and have received a handful of (very complimentary) reviews. The lead time is enormous. It's not clear if any have led to sales or downloads.
* Prize submissions: We've submitted the book to a handful of book prizes, but those are still pending.

What we haven't done:

* Author website
* Paid ads
* Other social channels (FB, IG, X)

Printing My Full-Color Art Book Overseas: Tips on Color Management and File Setup,"I’m gearing up to print my self-published hardcover art book for an upcoming Kickstarter:

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wendichen/love-tide-the-art-of-wendi-chen-art-book

For anyone here who wants to make a full-color art book (or a children’s book), I wanted to save you all a lot of headache with the knowledge I’ve learned:

1) Figure out your book size as soon as possible (mine is 8.5” x 8.5”) and ask for page spread / cover templates. I learned that the standard bleed is .125” on hardcover books, so I included it on all my full-bleed pages.

2) Always make sure the resolution on your art files is 300 DPI or higher. I tend to build my files at 450-600 DPI.

3) Create your art file in an RGB color space with a wide gamut, such as Adobe RGB (1998). This will give you more colors, and thus more leeway when you convert to CMYK at the end.

4) Learn to use professional book layout software like Adobe InDesign (I learned it in two days so it’s not too hard), or pay a professional to do it for you. Canva is not going to cut it for a large format, photo-quality coffee table book.

5) Many printers will darken your colors slightly. You may need to adjust for this at the pre-press stage, so the best thing to do is to pay extra for a hardcopy proof. If you’re a stickler for color accuracy like me, then it’s worth it!

6) Always convert to CMYK color mode when you export your book as a Print PDF.

7) When working with an overseas printer (my printer is based in Guangzhou, China), be as clear as possible and label/name your files very cleanly. Make sure to account for long shipping times and don’t try to rush the production process.

That’s all I’ve got so far! :) Good luck and happy self-publishing!

"I love you, mom!","After going blind a little over 10 years ago, I began my writing career in an attempt to push back. The depression brought on by a new overwhelming, and never ending darkness all around me. Unlike ever before, I had an unyielding drive to complete something, not only to prove to myself that I was capable of doing so, but also to show my mother that even when she was no longer living her beautiful life, that she wouldn’t have anything to worry about in my direction.

With the help of my eventual editor, and a plethora of added content, I finish that book and published it on Amazon shortly there after. Since then the only person I ever wanted to have read that book was my mother. As a self publishing author, I have since then completed multiple projects in a newer series that I’ve been working on over the last few years and I’m happy to say that in my first year of truly self Publishing last year we sold more than 300 copies!

At long last, however, I was informed today that my mother is enjoying my first published book and I’m happy to report that I feel like today might be one of the best days of my life! Thank you mom, I love you and I appreciate all of your love and support.

Love, hopefully your favorite Blind author!

Amazon KDP vs Lulu for self-publishing coloring book comparison: unexpected and puzzling results.,"Around two months ago I decided to self-publish a dinosaur coloring book to try and give a new purpose to a bunch of dinosaur drawings (51 exactly) that I made several years ago for a failed project (a publishing deal that eventually fell apart because of the 2008 economic crisis, which hit southern Europe hard). It felt like a waste to have done so much work for nothing, so I thought I should ultimately do something for them to finally see the light of day in book form. 

I chose Amazon KDP first because it has the biggest potential reach and they are said to offer reasonable quality at an affordable price. I then learned of Lulu, which apparently offers a higher quality product and bigger earnings through royalties, but at an accordingly higher price tag.

I decided to upload the book to both platforms, and ordered print proof copies. The Lulu arrived first. It looked and felt pretty good. Colors on the cover were a tiny bit over-saturated and dark, but that would be nitpicking, really. Good quality paper and covers. The biggest disappointment came in the coloring pages themselves, where the ink is not 100% black and looks a little washed out, like a very dark gray. I thought it should look bolder. Still, it felt like a quality product and it was a joy finally having it in my hands.

Then the Amazon KDP version arrived and… it was better. Noticeably better. Quality of the paper and covers was roughly the same, but the colors on the covers looked closer to my original file, and the ink on the inner coloring pages was black and bold, as it should be. Needles to say, I did NOT expect that. To add insult to injury, the book was rejected by Lulu’s ‘Global Distribution’ program, which allowed for it to be sold by major book retailers, for having “insufficient content” (it’s a coloring book, I don’t know what else could they expect). It’s still available to purchase from Lulu themselves online, but at a higher price than Amazon’s identical counterpart and offering arguably worse printing quality.

Now I’m thinking of just retiring the book from Lulu and focusing on promoting the Amazon version. It just feels wrong to have a higher price alternative ($9.90 vs $18.00!) that offers no quality advantage and even can be considered worse. It just doesn’t make any sense, even if I can get more money from potential sales on Lulu. It would be ethically wrong.

Cheap editors/proofreaders and cover designers for short stories?,"I've been a longtime fantasy writer but have never considered actually publishing my work until this year. My goal is to dip my toe into getting my world, which I've been building for what is probably close to half my life, out there by writing short stories and self-publishing them until I feel confident and experienced enough to go for a full-length novel.

So my first story is 20,000 words. I've drafted, redrafted, and self-edited it, and I just got beta reader copies back. I'm getting close to being ready to publish this sucker, but there's two things I need first: an edit, and a cover.

Now, I'm trying to keep this as cheap as possible. I'm not trying to make a living off this; I just wanna publish some ebooks for my friends and family to buy, maybe the occasional stranger, but I don't wanna throw a bunch of money at making print copies or anything. So keep that in mind.

I'm a professional newspaper editor by day, so I'm familiar with the editing process, and the story itself is short, so I feel my copy is pretty clean. However, I know I'm too close to this story to see any remaining issues. My beta readers caught some, but I'm sure there are others. Does anyone have any recommendations for a good, cheap editor that can just make sure there are no glaring edits I need to make? I'm talking copyediting, basically.

What about a cover? I want something decent, but I don't wanna break the bank, so is there a go-to website or something Redditors regularly use to commission cover designs?

Advice on moving from KDP to IngramSpark,"I currently have 8 (soon to be 9) works that I have released through KDP. For a number of reasons, I am considering moving to using IngramSpark for my distribution. (These include getting my titles out to more platforms and concerns about Amazon.)

If I am reading the information from IngramSpark correctly, I will have to pull my titles from Kindle Select for 90 days before I can release them anywhere else, which is not an issue since I've gotten almost no reads there. I also will have to wait a year after my last KDP release before Ingram can push my titles to Amazon.

My main question is which approach should I take once I am ready to move to IngramSpark: publish simultaneously on both KDP and IngramSpark indefinitely, or let my newer works be unavailable through Amazon for 12 months. 

Complicating this decision is that most of my works are part of a series. I have not been focused on making each story fully standalone, so a reader who jumps in at the middle might have some issues following everything. I am slowing down from my initial burst of creativity, so I can take a break and not start releasing through IngramSpark mid-series. But I do worry that I might cut off readers (if I get any) if there is a year-long gap on Amazon.

FWIW: The other likely source of delay is that I need to budget the $600 for a block of ISBNs. I already have enough books out there that I need to buy the block of 100 since I'd spend more buying them in blocks of 10.

Simple store front for marketing that redirects to Amazon?,"Hi all! I'm looking for a way to set up a very simple site/shop with

1. a shop front (grid of books)
2. a product page per book with a redirect to Amazon for the actual checkout 

Something like this [https://v7mysz-i8.myshopify.com/](https://v7mysz-i8.myshopify.com/).

I like the Shopify setup above but the redirect requires custom code which then means an expensive plan. Other alternatives I've come across are Big Cartel and Payhip. Waiting to hear back if custom code is possible with them.

Any other alternatives you can recommend? Ideally not more than 10$ / month. 

Thanks!",1,13,2025-03-14,IEA001,N/A,0.67
Publishing is Expensive,"UPDATE: I want to update everyone since my post below on what I found so far. I reached out to editing accounts on instagram and found a very nice editor who had very cheap pricing for great quality. She did a test chapter for free and she will deifintely be the person I go to from now on! I think I'm paying around $1,000 for the entirety of my novel for a miriad of editing features. So find freelance editors on instagram or facebook!

Hi! I am in desperate help of some advice on self-publishing. I understand I can edit and publish on Ingram Spark for basically free, but I want this book to be an actual somewhat success, so I am willing to invest in editing, marketing, design, etc. However, I have reached out to freelancers on Reedsy and her quota to edit my 80,000-word count book was going to be $2,500 and a quota to design the cover was going to be $650. Then, I thought well if I am already going to spend quite a bit for individual freelancers, maybe I should look into packages from companies that help you self-publish, except that those packages for anything worthwhile are around $7,000. So, my first question is how does anyone self-publish these days? Second, are these costs normal? Should I expect that I will need to be investing a sizeable amount to publish? Any other options?

Just Published My First 3 Books – Looking for Illustrator Recommendations!,"Hi everyone,

I just published my first three books on KDP and am now diving into the marketing side of things. As I continue expanding my work, I’m on the lookout for illustrators, and I wanted to see if there are any here in this community.

I primarily write children’s books that focus on parenting struggles, covering topics like chronic pain, disabilities, depression, and anxiety—things that many families experience but don’t always see represented in kids’ books.

I wrote these books after experiencing my own chronic pain journey over the past 12 months. It’s been a challenging time, and with four children and not being able to earn an income, money is tight, so I’m looking for affordable but high-quality illustration options.

I’ve tried Fiverr, but to be honest, the experience wasn’t great. I’d love any advice or recommendations on where to find good illustrators, whether that’s through agencies, individual artists, or other freelancer platforms.

Could a massive amount of books with no KDP advertising gain traction theoretically?,"Hey guys! 

  
I am retired and want to spend the rest of my life writing. Its my passion. I can write two romance novellas a week. I currently have 10 unpublished novellas, and want to spend this entire year writing nonstop, putting me at 60 novellas for the year.

Theoretically, if I spent no money on ads or did any other form of marketing, would the KDP algorithm boost my books slowly because of the volume?

Assuming I get hardly any reviews in the beginning and more will come later as more books come out.

Ingram spark,"I have a book published from Ingram spark. I signed up to offer a 45% discount to retail stores.  A local bookstore contacted me wanting to sell my book so looked jt up on Ingram distribution. They sent me a screenshot of it - they can only get it at 25% discount (they require 40% for their profit margins) so can not carry it. I contacted Ingram to try and understand why the 45% was not extended to the bookstore and they told me I had to increase my book price and up my discount to 55% (although the math still doesn’t add up to 40 plus discount for store) or I would lose over $1 per book. This seems like such a scam!!! It’s outrageous to suggest that I need to lose money on each book so they can maintain their profit!  

Are there ethical book publisher/ distributors that pass on the discounts to bookstores (and not take 20% plus themselves) or at least honestly state it up front?  Thanks for any thoughts/ guidance.

1. A company that can produce the book (it's text, no images or very very few images) at an affordable price with the ability to have 1 printed so I can see what it'll look like before I buy larger quantities

Do you ever feel.. regret? Unsure where to go next?,"Throwaway since friends and family know my account. 

I self-published a novel in 2021, with the intention of it being a trilogy. Over the past 4 years, I’ve changed a lot. The concept of my first novel intrigues me, but my writing style is totally different, and, in all honesty, I feel a bit ashamed of the novel. Maybe it’s because I’ve started to surround myself with writers that aspire to be traditionally published, or are traditionally published, but I feel like I made a mistake (even though nothing bad has happened to me from publishing my novel), not including actual grammar mistakes or cringe worthy lines I’ve noticed in attempts to reread it. 

I’m just not sure what to do. I know that most of my feelings are powered by insecurity, insecurity that my biggest piece of public writing isn’t my best work, insecurity because of the new space I’m in. I don’t want this regret, this book, to weigh on me anymore,  but I don’t know how to move on, or if I even should.

Negative Reviews,"Made the mistake and checked out my negative reviews on Amazon and Goodreads. I wouldn't suggest doing this. Thankfully, there are only two. The one on Amazon said, ""Writes at a fifth grade level. Lacks understanding of basic physics.""

Wow!

Most of my reviews are positive, thank God! So the ""fifth grade level"" comment hurt at first. But it soon washed off me a bit with the second half: ""Lacks understanding of basic physics."" My story is sci-fi, but it's not hard sci-fi. I don't get too deep into the science because it skews space opera and there isn't a ton of physics in it. So no idea what they were talking about. They, of course, left no example for me to go on. I wonder if they meant I defied some law of physics. I try to adhere to it as best I can, usually. None of my beta readers pointed out any issues concerning physics.

As far as this Amazon reviewer goes, I think they were trolling because they were not a ""verified purchaser"" so screw them.

My negative Goodreads review was really weird. I received two stars, but no written review. I decided to check the reviewer's reading history. It was pretty extensive. But 90% of the books she read were historical fiction. And the other 9.9% were contemporary mysteries. My book was the only sci-fi on this person's list. Everything else got 4 or 5 stars. Meanwhile, the one science fiction she reads she gives it 2? Is this a thing? Are they a troll? So confused.

Does anyone find these instances weird? Has anyone else found situations like this in your reviews? Or do you avoid your reviews all together?",8,21,2025-02-07,Inevitable_Rent8176,N/A,0.83

Amazon KDP Australia,"
Question: How Does Amazon KDP Work for a 22-23 Page Children’s Book? Pricing, Royalties & Bookstore Distribution?

Hi everyone,

I’m in the process of self-publishing my first children’s book and looking for advice on Amazon KDP and self-publishing in general. My book, Mummy Can’t, But Mummy Can!, is a 22-23 page children’s picture book that highlights the challenges of parenting with chronic pain while focusing on the love and connection between a mother and her child.

I have a few questions about the self-publishing process, especially with Amazon KDP:
	1.	Pricing & Royalties – How do authors typically price a full-color, 22-23 page children’s book? What percentage does Amazon take, and is there a way to estimate how much I’d make per sale?
	2.	Getting into Bookstores – If I publish through KDP, can I still get my book into local bookstores or retailers? Or do bookstores avoid stocking Amazon-printed books?
	3.	Bulk Printing & Selling Myself – Can I order bulk copies of my book from KDP and sell them myself (through my own website, markets, events, etc.)? Or is it better to use a different printer for bulk orders?
	4.	Advertising & Marketing – Does KDP allow me to promote my book outside of Amazon? Can I run ads on social media, my own website, or local bookstores?
	5.	Alternative Printing Options – Would it be better to use another printing service (IngramSpark, Lulu, or local printers) for higher-quality bulk orders and wider distribution?

I want to make sure I’m choosing the best self-publishing path for my book while keeping it accessible to readers. Any insights or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

Best Way to Sell Author Copies of My Book? Online or In-Person?,"I ordered some author copies of my book because a few friends wanted to buy them locally. The main reason is that Amazon’s delivery to Pakistan costs more than the book itself, which is just ridiculous.

Now I’m trying to figure out the best way to sell them. I already have a website, so setting up an online store wouldn’t require extra investment, the book might end up being a bit expensive since I’d have to factor in delivery charges. On the other hand, there’s a monthly event in my city where new businesses set up stalls to sell their products. I could try that, though there’s a registration fee. The upside? I’d get to interact with readers directly, which sounds fun.

Blurb opinions?,"Book is set to release soon and I still have yet to find an intriguing blurb. Here is what I have so far.

  
When eighteen-year-old Selena King celebrates her High School Graduation, she hardly expects a Chimera to set the stage aflame before she could get her diploma, nonetheless the monster being decapitated by a lightning wielding demigod. Then her wounds from the attack heal in record time. It’s hard for her brain to comprehend everything that just happened, when there was no evidence left behind of the attack, besides blood drenching her graduation gown.



This is Selena’s first meeting with one of the Marked, Greek demigods who possess the power of their patron god, dedicated to protecting Olympus. It’s also her first encounter with Major, the son of Zeus who looks a lot like a model but has a major god complex–no pun intended. Selena is pulled into Major’s world when her parents disappear and another not-so-mythical monster hunts her down.  But why would monsters be interested in ordinary mortals like the King family?

Children's Book Advice,"Hello! I was wondering if I could get some advice/tips when it comes to self publishing, specifically a children's book. 

A little back story — I want to start out by saying I am by no means a writer, I am actually a graphic designer so my knowledge about writing stories and publishing is slim. I have only recently started to research as this idea of publishing a children's book popped in my head. The idea came from when I was in middle school, we had a writing test one day where we had to come up with a folktale. I ended up winning an award for one of the best stories and recently I started thinking, what if I was to publish it. I have always been very proud of that story and have thought about it here and there over the years. 

My question is, has anyone published a children's book before? If so, what was your experience like in doing so? Did you have any help? How long did the process take? How much was invested into the process? Where do *you* sell your book (online or specific stores)?",3,1,2025-01-28,Mimi1208,N/A,1.0
First Successfully Published Book! How I did it correctly this time around.,"Hey all, 

Over the past decade, I’ve self-published half-a-dozen books, and none of them really took off. Looking back, I can see the mistakes I made, which held those books back from their potential. This time, I worked with a professional publisher, and my latest book has been a success. I’m not here to promote it—I’m here to share what I learned from the professionals so that you can apply these strategies to your self-publishing efforts.

What I did this time around:

1. **Build Anticipation** Before writing, I created buzz by posting on my professional social media networks. I shared my intention to write a book, and the support was overwhelming. I posted semi-regular updates, including an early outline. Many of those followers became pilot readers, and later, buyers.
2. **Research Publishers** I researched Amazon and Barnes & Noble's top books in my genre and identified their publishers. Then, I reached out to several and eventually signed with one that aligned with my vision.
3. **Pilot Readers for Early Feedback** I recruited pilot readers to review early drafts. They provided invaluable insights and perspectives I hadn’t considered. Their feedback helped me refine the book, and I made sure to acknowledge each of them in the final product.
4. **Graphics by a Trusted Source** My son created all the graphics, and while the publisher wanted to use their own cover art, I held firm. I’m thrilled with the final look, and it’s a personal touch I wouldn’t trade.
5. **Professional Copy Editing** The publisher provided an excellent editor, which made a big difference. That said, I’ve worked with freelance editors for self-published books before, and the experience is similar—though slower when working with a publisher.
6. **Website and Newsletter** I built a website and newsletter myself to maintain creative control. This has been a great way to engage readers and share updates.
7. **Staggered Releases and Awards** I launched the ebook first, with no marketing, to test the waters. Submitting for awards paid off: the book won a Literary Titan Award in December and a PenCraft Award in January. These accolades delayed the print release to update the cover and text but added credibility.
8. **ARC Review Campaigns** I ran an advanced reader copy (ARC) campaign, giving free copies in exchange for honest reviews. It’s challenging—many people won’t leave reviews—but using a reputable platform helps limit scams.
9. **Paperback and Hardcover Release** This month, I released the book on multiple platforms, with ISBNs provided by the publisher. Wider distribution via Barnes & Noble and IngramSpark made a big difference.
10. **Professional PR and Ads** The publisher ran a global PR campaign, targeting major media outlets. They also started an Amazon ad campaign focused on getting the book onto bestseller lists. I learned that ebooks need to be priced at $2.99 to qualify for most lists.



Going the traditional publisher route has been slower but more thorough. They pushed me to submit for awards, secure media coverage, and position the book strategically—all things I wouldn’t have done on my own.

Here’s the thing: almost everything they did, you can do as a self-published author. It takes time, research, and sometimes money, but the tools and opportunities are out there. Best of luck on your journey!",52,30,2025-01-28,danarchyx,N/A,0.98

Which eBook Aggregator? - Unique Situation,"So, I have what I think is a unique situation. I've been reading a ton of reviews and feedback from all of the posts on Reddit regarding the various sites (i.e., Bookbaby, IngramSpark, Draft2Digital, etc.).

I'm helping a US-based Christian non-profit who has been self-publishing their printed books for 40+ years release their over 60+ titles as ebooks. Their staff will be converting the printed books to .epub files in house with all of the typesetting, footnotes, covers, etc. Since there are many special characters in Greek and Hebrew, they've found that in-house is best after they tried some tools for conversion. They currently have one file ready to go for testing.

* They have an international market and expect high sales in the Africa, South America and the US. So, international reach is a **must.** (They will also have sales in EU, Canada, Australia and many other countries.)
* They'll be releasing most titles in three languages (English, French and Spanish).
* Over the next 5 years, they'll likely sell at least 5,000 copies of each title.
* They may not need ISBN numbers from the aggregator. They may be able to purchase them the same way they do for their printed books. Either way, they'll want to own their ISBN number.
* They also already do business with CDBaby for 15+ albums.
* They need a proof. With proofing being a huge part of publishing in print, they want to be able to proof the eBook that will be distributed out. This is a must and cannot be skipped.
* Marketing is not needed. They'll do their own marketing.
* Print books are not needed. They already print high-quality, foiled, clothbound books.

They are not interested in managing the publishing of these by going directly through Amazon and other places. They definitely want a company to distribute as it will help their team navigate this very new avenue of publishing.

The flat-rate distribution that BookBaby offers is very appealing. They also provide a proof.  
Two years ago, they tried to navigate conversion with BookBaby from a PDF file (which is what BookBaby asked for) and they were unable to support the special characters and the footnotes in the conversion.

I've looked at Draft2Digital and the 10% fee is a little bit of a turn-off with the expected sales volumes.

IngramSpark changed their pricing structure since the non-profit did their initial research 2 years ago. Looks like they charge a 1% distribution fee.

Here are my questions:

1. Does BookBaby allow for distribution of your own .epub file? Or, do you have to use their conversion feature for distribution?
2. Does IngramSpark offer proofs for eBooks? (I find their FAQ and website very limited on the information it shares. I had to dig through Google to find their actual price list.)
3. What recommendations would you have for their specific scenario? Which route would you go?

Beware BookBaby ISBNs,"I recently had a press proof of a novel I wrote printed by BookBaby. I designed the cover and formatting myself, and wanted to make sure it looked good before I ordered a big run.

In the same order, I made the mistake of purchasing an ISBN from BookBaby. Heads up: BookBaby buys ISBNs in bulk from Bowker, so they can resell them to you cheaper. The catch is, though, BookBaby will be listed as the PUBLISHER of your book, even if all they did was print it.

When I complained to my service rep, she sent me a tiny link to a FAQ page that basically tells you this. But their consumer-facing purchasing describes it as “BookBaby will register your ISBN for you.” Really, it should say “AS you.” 🤬🤬🤬

The end result is that once the ISBN for a book is registered, the publisher cannot be changed or transferred for the same ISBN. After several emails with Bowker, I’ve discovered the way out of this predicament so my book can be registered with my own publishing company is to purchase a new ISBN/barcode, slap it on the back cover and front matter, and possibly issue it as a Second Edition so there’s no conflict between the title and the two ISBNs.

Anyway, this whole ordeal has been sketchy at best, and strikes me as a predatory practice. They do excellent print work, I’ll give them that, but I would never give them any distribution rights to my work, now or ever. If you did, be sure to go back and read Section 4 in the 22-page contract you signed in that tiny online window that allows them to record and sell your book in AI voices. Also the part in the first 3 or so pages where they inform you they can change the terms of your contract with them any time they want to, for any reason, as long as they give you 3-weeks notice by email.

🙄

self-publishing novellas & short stories,"Hi everyone! New here - both in self-publishing, and on Reddit!

I am a writer with a bunch of finished novellas and short stories in my drawer, and a bunch of ideas for more. I also have ideas for novels, but I want to take as much time as possible to develop those properly, so I thought that, whilst I work at my novels, it would be a good idea to start self-publishing my short stories and novellas in a series as e-books.

I write mainly horror/splatterpunk, I would publish under a pseudonym, and I think I could easily churn out 5-6 a year, maybe less, or maybe more, depending on the length of each one. My goals doing this are:

1.      To have fun

2.      To practise my writing on something I don’t care about as much as my novels

3.      To begin sharing my work with some readers and earning a little money  

I guess I will learn the chops as I go, but my question is: what sort of online presence should I set up in order to drive readers to my ebooks? Should I set up a website with a newsletter? A Facebook or Instagram page? Should I post on Watpadd-like apps? Is an online presence even needed, or are Amazon ads sufficient? I would like to focus on writing as much as possible, and I really don’t want to run 10 different social media at the same time, so I think maybe I should just pick one social media, or blog/website, and focus on it?

Downside of Publishing Audiobook as Downloadable MP3,"I've been asked by the publishing house I work with to explore the down sides of selling our first audiobook as a downloadable MP3, rather than going through a producer and/or retailer like Audible, but I don't have a lot of experience.  I've learned enough to know an MP3 file can be loaded into an audiobook player, like Audible or Google Play Books, but would they have the same navigation—chapters, etc—as when managed by these producers from the outset?  Also seems it would be largely unprotected, in terms of copying a sharing.

  
Any other points I should know about would be greatly appreciated.

I have written a few kids book over the last one year. They are for kids aged 6-10. I have finished the illustrations for the first book and plan to publish it by end of January.

Do You See Your Struggles in Stories?,"
I write symbolic stories that reflect real-world problems—things like addiction, growth, and the struggles we face in pursuit of a better life. These aren’t just stories; they’re explorations of what it means to be human, told through layers of symbolism.

For example:
	•	A moth chasing a distant flame discovers the line between passion and self-destruction.
	•	A climber scaling an endless mountain learns the power of finding joy in the journey, not just the peak.
	•	A seed breaking through the soil fights to grow while the weight of the earth holds it back.

If you’ve ever felt like your challenges are part of a larger story, these tales might resonate with you.

First big milestones doesn't feel as good as I thought,"Hello, I self publishing under a pen name. I had to do it because I was getting very emotionally attached to my books, to the point that I wasn't open to any feedback. For example, on the book cover, book description, chapters, lenght etc.   


So I decided to write under a pen name, distance myself and be more objective. This helped me a lot, I've learnt so much about marketing. Probably to much, I looked at my competitors, over optimised everything in my offer, and it worked! This December was the first month I reached $1000 in passive income, and... it's not what I thought it would feel like.  
  
I thought I would be very happy and relieved. Instead, I feel it's not worth it, all the sacrifices I made to get there. I know it will scale; each month there is more and more progress. I am just surprised it doesn’t bring relief or happiness. I wonder if this ever happened to you. I don’t know how to interpret it. Thank you in advance for your support; I really appreciate it.

Publishers and Me Getting  Paid,"About 6 months ago I received a letter from a Miss ""X""(who will remain unnamed) stating that authors needed a service which would trace down the number of books sold and then go after the Publishers to have monies paid to the author.

Obviously no one here is using AI to write their whole book (I hope!), but would it be helpful to have discussions of what (if any) AI tools everyone is using in their self-publishing businesses?

Is it a good idea to self-publishing a novelette? ,"I've been researching about this a lot. Learning pros and cons of publishing a novelette. I know novelletes/ novellas aren't as popular as full-length novels, but my story is such that if I convert it into a novel, I think it would lose its essence.

Although I have read that not many readers prefer novellas/novelletes, I do want to go ahead and publish it.

I'm contemplating a lot about it. But I also don't want to ruin my story by adding unnecessary elements (I tried to convert it into a novel and it felt that it wasn't what I wanted). Plus, I'm from India, I'm not even sure there are any popular novelettes from my country.

Here are a few questions I have about it to start with:

• Does anyone have any experience in publishing them?

Or any idea about it in general?

Should I go for self-publishing? I know it costs a lot but I do prefer that over hybrid publishing because i feel that it is such a scam. But it costs a lot. I also don't think I can wait for so long for traditional publishing and the limited amount of control I have over my story (and I doubt any trad publishers do accept it).

Very confused!! And also overwhelmed.

What tips/recommendations would you offer to a new author?

Publish 2 book 1s at the same time?,"Sorry, this is a bit long. I'm getting ready to pull the trigger on self-publishing. This sub has been extremely useful in preparation. I have seen some good responses to questions about publishing two books of the same series at the same time. But I have a slightly different question that I haven't seen answered yet. Then a related question about platform.

I have written 4.75 novels. Novels 1 and 2 were training novels, 200k words of trash. They will never see the light of day. Novel 3 is probably my favorite. It straddles sci-fi and fantasy, with some Christian mythology (think *Constantine* crossed with *Fringe*). I'll be the first to admit it’s a bit weird. But it was the book I wanted to read. It's about 100k and can easily be made into a series. I also like novel 4, which is 80k that fits squarely in science fiction. It can also be made into a series. Probably the best writing is novel 5, which is unfinished but at about 70k of an expected 90-100k words and a really cool concept in science fiction. I'm an avid reader of the genre, both past and present work, and I've not seen the concept before.

I've never queried novel 3, but novel 4 got a handful of full requests from some pretty important agents, but never an offer of representation (I was formerly represented by an Aevitas agent for a non-fiction book, but that didn't work out). Between the two, I want to write the sequel to novel 3 more than I want to write the sequel to novel 4.

So, my question: Should I publish both novel 3 and 4 at nearly the same time, or one rather than other (and if that, which one)? If both, do I see which one sells, then write that sequel?

Related question. I am a professional bioethicist. Among professional bioethicists, I am one of the most widely read internationally (not nearly the most cited, or most ""famous"", but a lot of people read my academic work, at least compared to my professional peers). I've published a lot of papers in the biggest journals on things like gene editing, neurotech, enhancement, climate change, research ethics, abortion, medical ethics, public health, etc. I've also published a book from a major academic press. This is relevant for a couple of reasons. First, novels 4 and 5 come *directly* from my research. (Or, as it happened, I wrote the novels first, research second). Second, I have a ready-made platform of expertise on these topics, with a potential readership. However, I tend to be polarizing and get lots of hate-mail, especially from the alt-right and radical left, so I have no social media presence. I have decided to publish novels under a pen name.

So, second question: should I try to use that expertise in marketing, and, if so, how do I do that anonymously?",4,12,2024-11-26,dantes202,N/A,1.0

How we are selling books on Amazon in 2024,"We are having decent success on Amazon right now with our approach to marketing our books using the 'free promo' method. Here's we what we are doing in a nutshell:

1. Writing a Series of Short Stories
2. Publishing them Individually
3. Compiling them into a Collection
4. Publishing the Collection
5. Enrolling Individual Stories + Collection in KU
6. Every Story Contains a Link to the Collection
7. Giving away each of the Individual Stories in turn
8. Promoting whilst Free on Reddit

The stories we write are in one of the genres for which short stories do well (scifi/horror/erotica). Personally I think you need to select a genre that you find interesting enough to stick with.

The object of this approach is to sell the collection(s) and that is working for us at present, but we also manage to sell individual stories too.

We use KU for a number of reasons including the ability to give books away on a 5 days time-limited basis.

We setup a sub here on Reddit where we promote and at present have over 2K subscribers and growing.

We use Books2Read links because that gets readers to the appropriate Amazon store for their country and also (important) Reddit will display a thumbnail which we like, so our sub looks great both on desktop and mobile.

So the next time you are running a free promo (permafree or time-limited) why not post in our sub?

Just remember:

1. Must be a Kindle Book
2. Must be Free (permafree or time-limited)
3. Must use a books2read link
4. Must clearly specify permafree in the title (if permafree)
5. Must show Free Dates in title (if time-limited offer)

Also with books2read links, please add ?affiliate=off at the end of the link.

That's about it.

Thanks to the Mods here for allowing me to post.

I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

Best wishes and good luck to you all.

Libraries and IngramSpark,I'm in the UK. A book club wants to do my book - some of them prefer to borrow it from the library. I am with Ingram Spark (and KDP). Is it a question of getting the individual library to order it via IngramSpark or how does it work please?,2,6,2024-11-22,Ideaswise,N/A,1.0
The waiting game of publishing,"I write a lot and I publish often. There is always one or more project on the go. But I find that self-publishing and likely publishing in general is a waiting game that drives me crazy. First you write than you wait for feedback, you wait for editors to return the work, you wait for readers, you wait for reviews, and on and on. Drives me crazy. I guess I have limited patience and perhaps that's why I went with self-publishing. There are things I can do while I wait...perhaps I'll start another book!",2,6,2024-11-22,deleted,N/A,1.0

Please tag up your meta pixels when running Facebook ads! ,"So Meta have recently come out and said that the difference in sales between traffic and conversion objectives is as high as 74%. 

(If you’re new to ads, that’s the objective the option you chose at the start) 

Now as some of you may know you can’t run conversion objectives unless your Meta pixel is tagged up to your site. 

*big note* if you run your ads straight to an Amazon page you wont be able to EVER do this — which is why I bang on about having a website so much for any author, new or established. 

If you do have a website, make sure you tag your your pixel and ensure your setting your Facebook campaigns to optimise for “conversions” and not “landing page views” or “link clicks” 

Not that hard, the event manager is really simple and there is loads of videos on it!

Hope it helps. 👍🏼",2,9,2024-11-20,uwritem,N/A,1.0
Creating PDF Books Readable on Smartphones,"I’ve published nearly a hundred books for other authors over the past years. During that time I used KDP Amazon, beginning when it was Createspace, IngramSpark, Lulu Press, Smashwords; now Draft2Digital and had good luck with all of them.

My favorite to date is KDP Amazon for simplicity and large market. I also like IngramSpark and Lulu Press, although I believe Lulu’s prices are a little higher than necessary. Draft2Digital has either acquired or merged with Smashwords and they are growing impressively, so I plan to use them more in the future.

What these companies have in common is that they tightly control the process. If you use their internal or global marketing, the commission is high. This requires a higher price to ensure a profit from book sales. For this reason, I encourage the sale of author copies with your own marketing activities. You may not have the exposure that global marketing brings, but most books just disappear among the millions of books that are part of global marketing. I will write more on selling author copies, but this post is about PDF books you create without the involvement of any large company.

The problem with PDF files is that most of them are on letter size (8.5X11 inch) files. This poses no problem for most computers or laptops because the display is large enough to maintain the font size clarity. If you open one of those files on your mobile phone, even using it horizontally, the font size is too small for easy reading.

That seems like a serious issue because the file size is so common many assume it’s the only way to use PDF. That’s not true. PDF can be used with any size file. Of course, it’s a lot of trouble to create a custom page size but it’s unnecessary. There is a page size that fits a mobile phone screen with a 12 pt font and no adjustments.

It really isn’t a page size; it’s an envelope size and it’s called Monarch Envelope or Envelope Monarch. The size is 3.88 inches X 7.5 inches. As an envelope the page would be horizontal, but you need only switch it to vertical and you have a perfect size for a book to read on a mobile phone.

The margins on the Monarch page can be set at .125 which is 1/8 inch and all the rest of the setting can be handled exactly as you would for any word document.

You can create a special front and back cover by using any free artwork on Pixabay or Canva and then just convert the file to a PDF and you are ready to create a link to sell it anywhere.

I created a PDF book with complete instructions and it yours free just by clicking the link below. No need to leave your email. Just download it and read it. Please comment once you’re done. Here is the link:

AI images for book trailers - Please don't,"Recently seen book trailers, the pride and joy of their authors. Cheap to do but just awful. If you insist on using AI generated images, could you at least check that they make sense?

Missing hands, six fingers, etc. A lady in a gown dancing in a ballroom, when she turns all definition is lost on her face and arms, she is totally distorted. She looks like a dancing blob.

My book Age of Antiheroes is now available!,"**Unleash the Flames of Revolution**  

Dive into a spellbinding fantasy romance that will keep you on the edge of your seat, packed with electrifying twists and an irresistible enemies-to-lovers slow burn. Brace yourself for a tale that grapples with mature themes as it delves into the heart of a shattered world.  

In the year 3035, humanity has teetered on the brink of collapse. A legacy of relentless war, injustice, and environmental ruin has granted the elite an iron grip over the planet's dwindling resources. Their twisted solution? The creation of genetically engineered superhumans, designed to protect their interests while subjugating the rest of society.  

Enter Ares, a fierce and determined survivor fighting not just for her own life but for the future of her loved ones. When her world is turned upside down in a heartbeat, she is thrust into a dark reality that shatters her every belief. Driven by a thirst for vengeance, she vows to eradicate the so-called heroes that the elite have crafted... until she crosses paths with Maximus, a formidable superhuman who shares her burning desire for justice.  

Torn between her instincts and the tantalizing connection that sparks between them, Ares decides to forge a treacherous alliance with her sworn enemy. Together, they embark on a perilous journey to dismantle the corrupt regime that has enslaved their world. But as they delve deeper into the heart of rebellion, Ares grapples with a haunting question: Can she truly trust a man-made weapon, or will he become the very agent of her demise?  

Prepare for an exhilarating ride filled with betrayal, unlikely alliances, and a romance that ignites like wildfire. The battle for freedom has begun—will Ares rise as a hero, or will the flames of her vengeance consume her?

Formatting woes - illustrated print poetry book,"Heya folks, this might be a bit of an unusual request as I'm not pushing this project to any of the usual platforms. 

I'm formatting and illustrated poetry book for a client. He's aware I am NOT a formatter, I've been very upfront about that. We are printing through a local POD place, no ebook, and I'm using word. 

It's driving up the wall. The images keep clipping to the left margin, maybe hopping to the right, when I'd like the centred or just floating on the page. I've checked the wrapping and it's all good there, I DO NOT know why it's doing this. The only way to unlock it is to max the size until the width is bigger than the page - then I can move it around no worries. It's a pain in the ass though, especially with images that a narrow and vertical. 

I'd like to stick with word because the text formatting is a bit intricate as well, and I'm relying heavily on styles, auto-TOC, section breaks etc.

Is there a program that gives me all the text formatting love of word + better image layout? ",4,3,2024-11-13,Spellscribe,N/A,1.0

Who do I put as publisher when self publishing?,"
I have two options as I see it:
a) Come up with my own publishing ‘company’ and write “ Published By X” or,
b) Just write “Self Published”

I want this book to be picked up by a publishing company, so I’m not sure if writing that it’s published by another company (my ‘company’) already would help or hinder my aim of selling the rights. Conversely, I don’t know if writing “Self Published” comes across as professional enough. It’s a medical textbook, by the way.

1st Time Author - I need all of the advice I can get,"Hello reddit,

My name is Ryan, and I have just finished my second draft of a Historic Fiction novel (Mid-Eighteenth Century Colonial Period from the POV of a Cherokee protagonist). 166,608 words that I feel are now ready for an editor. A few months ago I was one of the fools that fell for the fake Macmillan Publisher scam, and sent $ to some clowns that were pretending to be Macmillan Publishers. I have learned a lot since, and also recovered my $ (thank you Mastercard).  However, that mess delayed my project that I would like to get moving forward already. 

I did find an editor that I think I should hire, but her price seems steep. I am certain that she is good though. I received editing quotes through [Reedsy.com](http://Reedsy.com) that ranged from $1200 to $8500, leaving me questioning if those editors were quoting apples or oranges. I hired somebody that I met on this platform to start working on a cover design (full wrap), and I am now trying to figure out next steps. I can see that I need to purchase ISBN Codes, find Beta readers, and follow an entire pre-launch process. I printed myself a to do list that I found on this platform, and I have a decent idea of the steps to take..... But I do not know the first company to look up, the first phone number to call, or what I can be doing right now to move my project forward. 

If the community here has some advice, companies, referrals, phone numbers, etc., I will be very much obliged. Things I would like to know:

1) How much should it cost for complete Developmental Edit on 166,608 words? (DE, which includes editorial comments involving structure, plot, pace, premise, tone, characterization, setting, dialogue, continuity, flow as well as line editing for grammar, punctuation, spelling, syntax and CMOS conformity)

2) Where should I buy ISBN codes? Going rate?

3) How many do I need to buy? (I want to sell on every platform I can)

4) Any amazing editors out there that you might recommend? (Historic Fiction)

5) Best way to get Beta readers? 

6) How, what, where, when, and who can help me with everything that needs to be done pre-launch?

7) Any recommendations for Marketing assistance?

8) Publisher recommendations?

9) All the things I do not even know to ask about?

10) Anybody want to read my novel in exchange for honest feedback?

Need help/ Is this Amazon publishing a Scam?,"\*\*ADDING MORE!!\*\*  
  
Hello everyone, I need some help:

I’m trying to self-publish a children’s book on Amazon. At first, paying $300 sounded fine, but now they want $1500 for marketing, a website, and copyright stuff…

I’m completely new to this, so I have no idea what is reasonable and what isn’t. If I can't pay the full $1100, they can accept two payments of $750 (one today and the other at the end of November).

Is this what normal self-publishing on Amazon is like? Should I be concerned? Am I being scammed, or is this what most self-publishing writers do when they want their kids' books published through Amazon? Is this not Amazon?

EDIT:

Here is a screenshot of the contract I was considering signing... and I thought it was all legit since it was through amazon... but... Shoot.

EDIT: Some other things!

They asked who told me self publishing should be free?

IngramSpark and independent retailer ordering,"I'm with IngramSpark. I have an independent retailer wanting to buy 10 copies of my book at their standard 50% discount.

Is there any way around this? My only other alternative appears to be for me to send 10 KDP author copies direct to the retailer, which generates less royalties.

Based on past experience when I was with a publisher, it's also likely that a few other independent retailers will also want to order my book. Is this experience likely to repeat itself?

Looking for feedback about my advice to writers...,"Hey everyone, I have launched a newsletter that teaches authors how to get to their first 50 sales per month and then how to scale to 200+ orders per month on their books.

At this stage, I'm just looking to get feedback on the content we are pushing out before we make anyone pay anything. If you're interested in just taking a look (completely free) and letting me know if anything is helpful or what might be missing - It would be really helpful! Admins too of course!

The aim is to create a space that teaches self-published authors how to really make a splash without the help of Trad. publishers!

There is nothing to pay, this is just like stress testing or a group Survey. And as a thank you if any of your feedback is used, I'm more than happy to give you a push to the group we already have which is about 10,500 people so far! Or a free cover, or marketing ad or anything (to an extent). 

Thanks,

General Publishing Advice?,"I've been wanting to become an author for years, and a few months ago (after a year and a half) I finally finished a rough draft to what is going to become my first book in the future. For context, the story I've written is dark-comedy Western. I recently did a first revision I've been sitting on, with extra scenes and tightening up the pacing and dialogue. And I'm seriously considering self-publishing through a service like Amazon KDP or Draft2Digital. I'm proud of myself for getting this far, but I'm so nervous at the same time. Now that I have a first revision in place, now what? I want to take the next step, but I just don't know where to start. Hopefully you guys can help me answer some questions:

*1) For any self-publishers, is there any particular service you would recommend? What were your experiences like? And for anyone who had their books published through a company, what enticed you to go that route over self-publishing?*

*2) What are the best places to look for beta readers? Would you recommend I pay for beta readers?*

*3) What have been your experiences in regards to hiring editors for your books? Do you think it was worth it, or did any of you opt to edit your own books?*

Being as this is uncharted waters for me, I'll gladly take any advice you guys give me. I'll even be happy to let you guys read the first chapter to my manuscript if any of you want. I'll also gladly answer any questions you may have, as best as I can!",2,8,2024-10-23,PEPSIMAN90,N/A,1.0
Creative Trailer House,"I think I was just contacted by a scam artist. Out of the blue, I received an email saying that there were investors interested and making a movie out of my book. The name was Pamela Goldstein with Verve agency. Today, I had a conversation with Michael something that was supposed to be with Studio Department. 

After a few more calls, I noticed that this John  Davis seemed to have the same accent as the first guy. At no time did I talk to Pamela Goldstein. 
Man do they have a great line. Really made it sound that this amazing opportunity was real. 

I did try to find something on Pamela and didn't see anything alarming. It wasn't until the first two calls that they asked for 3,000$ 

So I am putting this out there so no one else gets burnt with them. I obviously did not send money but it did get a tinge excited.

What's your secret for converting clicks into sales on Amazon?,"I've been advertising my novel on Facebook for almost a month and am happy so far with the results. This month to date my ad(s) have been seen by over 30,000 with a click through rate to my novel's page on Amazon a little over 5% and an average cost per click of less than ten cents. I mention that I have multiple ads, following the recommended strategy of creating three targeted demographics using the FB Ads Manager set up, and then each ad category has three different ads to see which is the most effective. 

But I'm not seeing as many sales in Amazon so far. If I have had over 1,500 click throughs to my Amazon page for the novel (offered both in Kindle and paperback format), how many sales conversions for these potential buyers should I expect? I know sales rates can vary for any number of reasons: the book cover should reflect the genre (I think mine does, it was professionally done), the reviews are at about 4 stars (but have less than ten reviews, so that might be a hindrance), and the sneak peak is for the first chapter with a big chunk of the second chapter as well. Pricing is competitive. 

So for those of you who have had success in Amazon, my question is what secrets to success can you provide? What is considered a ""decent' sales through rate from those who have clicked through your FB ad? ",7,10,2024-10-21,ProustsMadeleine1196,N/A,1.0

SPSFC4 Analysis Series- Sci Fi High Five,"SPSFC4 is a competition for self published science fiction, now in its fourth year.

As an entrant, I decided to analyse all 188 entries in order to assess their titles, covers, blurbs and sample chapters. The aim was to get insight into what makes indie books stand out, and reflect on how well my own book Our Vitreous Womb compares.

The series has almost reached its conclusion, but all the episodes are still available on my substack (www.haldanebdoyle.com). The last few episodes exploring the sample chapters are dropping over the coming days, culminating in an analysis of the biggest factors which put books on my TBR, and patterns in consistency across the title, cover, blurb and sample chapter for individual books. Sign up for free if you don't want to miss out.

*Gods. They play messy games.*

Dreams of death followed Helen. Her fate was set when she was chosen to be the oracle, but something always lingered, haunting her. Maybe it was the lack of knowledge of where she came from or who her parents were, but something always felt missing.  

It was only a few days before her coronation when her temple was attacked. The monsters kidnapped her and took her with them. When she lost everything, she thought that it was the end, but it was just the beginning of a game played against the rules that the gods had set.

After being captured, Helen discovered her abilities, and her need to learn about her parents grew, but the only person who could help her was Aiken. She needed his help, but the only thing she could offer was her power.

 

Aiken only had one goal, and it was to get his revenge. He was not a kind man, and his life was not easy – death was always one step after him, but that did not bother him. It was easy when he was always ready to die for the cause of vengeance.

Attacking the temples was supposed to be an easy job. It became complicated when a salve was gifted to him as a cruel joke. She brought memories of his past that he worked hard to forget. He did not want her, but he had to keep her to keep up appearances.  

Living with him, she learned too much, but maybe she could help him if he could earn her trust.",2,6,2024-10-15,ZoeyHayesDarkRomance,N/A,1.0
I Built BookletWizard – A Tool to Convert PDFs into Booklets for Self-Publishing and Small Businesses,"Hey everyone! 👋

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on called **BookletWizard**. It's a tool that converts PDFs into booklets, specifically designed for self-publishers, small business owners, educators, and anyone who needs to easily print professional booklets.

# Why I Built It:

As someone who works closely with authors and small business owners, I noticed a common challenge: creating print-ready booklets from standard PDF documents. Whether it's for marketing materials, course booklets, or self-published books, formatting and printing these documents can be a frustrating, time-consuming task. That’s why I decided to build **BookletWizard** – to simplify the process.

# What It Does:

* 📄 **Upload a PDF**
* 🖨️ **Print-ready PDFs**
* 🧾 Useful for **self-publishers**, **small businesses** (brochures, product guides), **educators**
* 🌐 Works entirely online, so no downloads or installations are needed.

# Who It’s For:

* **Self-publishers**: Convert your manuscript or project into a print-ready booklet.
* **Small businesses**: Print professional booklets for marketing or internal use.
* **Educators**: Prepare course materials and distribute printed booklets easily.

# How You Can Help:

I’d love to get feedback from this awesome community. If you’re someone who deals with printed booklets, or if you’re in self-publishing or running a small business, **would you find a tool like this useful?**

I’m also open to suggestions on how to make it better. Feel free to try it out and let me know what you think! You can check out the tool at [BookletWizard](https://booklet.dariocast.xyz)

# What’s Next:

I’m planning to add more features like direct printing integration and advanced formatting options, but I wanted to get the community’s thoughts on what would be most helpful first.

Thanks so much for reading and for any feedback you can provide! 🙌",4,1,2024-10-14,dariocast,N/A,1.0

Help please?! Complete novice with a tight schedule,"Hi all,

Apologies for there being many questions here that are likely raised before. I have tried searching but there are so many different answers that it is difficult to know what is right to use and I'm getting myself all confused.

About 2 years ago, I secretly started writing a book about my Grandads time during WW2. My Mum knew nothing about her Dad's time in the war, and always said she wished she knew more. For 2 years I have been gathering information from various archives, books, and family of those who served with Grandad in his unit (all without my Mum knowing) and have been writing it up in Scrivener. Its quite the book...as it is currently about 90-95% done at 165,000 words, or around 490 pages.

I have just hit the ""Compile"" button, and boy is the formatting a mess...like almost unreadable and is going to take some work to get it looking half-decent. I think it was because I was using ""tab"" (remember, I said I'm a complete novice) to indent certain parts of text from military reports. When I have tried to fix it, it only seems to cause issues elsewhere.

The questions I have (and I apologise in advance!) are:

1. What software should I go with to format the book? It's not going to be published, and will just be a single copy for my Mum. The book will contain images, tables, and I am using 3 different types of font within the book (1 for general text, 1 for quotes from soldiers who were present and 1 military typewriter font for reports from the Official War Diary). I am using a PC.
2. Are there any recommendations for printers in the UK? Due to the size, I will probably break it into two separate books, but only a single copy of each. I was thinking of looking at companies that offer printing of academic theses as they will specialise in A4 size books with images/diagrams with only 1 or 2 books requiring printing.
3. Any other words of advice will be greatly received. Desperately trying to get this finished in the next 4 months for Mums birthday...especially as her memory seems to be slipping.",3,4,2024-10-06,Volitans86,N/A,1.0
Should I self publish a coffee table book? How would I go about that?,"I have been traveling around Maine, taking pictures of old (early 1900's) postcards in the location of their original location. I think I have found about 30 of them (and getting more). I have made these new images into postcards of their own and people have been giving me great feedback. Several people have suggested making a coffee table book of sorts. I thought it would be cool to have these images with quotes from locals about their own, personal history of that location. I guess I just like seeing and hearing how things have changed. But I don't know the first thing about publishing. Do I need a manuscript? How would I design a manuscript? Should I seek out a publisher or just self publish? Is this too many questions for one post?

This book is about a young rabbit who hops around, looking for a beach. As he hops, he meets other animals along the way. It is a childrens book, meant for ages 3-8. 

I think the main thing I struggle with is advertising, as I am a teen author who is not allowed to have many social media's. But I will share the Book Trailer I made for this book and I hope you enjoy.

I would love opinions on this trailer, and would also love if anyone had easy advertisment ideas that I could try.

POD vendor for hardcover children's chapter books,"I've published 10 Kindle children's chapter books and am finally getting around to making print editions. I was impressed with KDP's paperbacks. The line drawing illustrations turned out very nicely with a very fine halftone dot pattern.

But the KDP hardcovers were another story. I like the case laminate cover for a children's book; dust jackets too often get torn and disappoint the child. But strangely the halftone dot pattern was significantly coarser than KDP paperbacks, resulting in illustrations that did not look nearly as good. Less importantly, I'm not a fan of the flat boarded spine. I prefer a boardless spine that curves gently with a curved text block.

So it's full speed ahead with KDP paperbacks. But for hardcovers, I'm looking for a another POD vendor. Any suggestions?",1,2,2024-10-01,GregL65,N/A,1.0

Update on book description,"Okay! I heard you all and have taken your comments as constructive feedback. This is my new description that I have added on to my preorder.

“In this immersive, plot-driven fantasy about dragons and political instability, you will find yourself eagerly turning page after page to reach the end.

When the dynamics shift for the royal family of Regnum, Sera finds herself in a vulnerable position as the spare to the throne. While trying to escape from her new title, she is caught by her stepmother's guard and left fighting for her life. Gravely injured, her astral form becomes trapped in an abyss with the Creation Goddess, Belinha, and three mysterious mirrors. The goddess guides her to find Elek, the one who holds the other end of Sera's Chain of Fate – a rare link indicating two people are destined for one another. Upon waking, she knows she must find the black dragon and develop her new abilities of Sight and Healing.

As for Elek, the Dragon Prince who can transform into a black dragon, the concept of destiny is a distraction from his duty as the crown prince of Demarcus. He is busy maintaining order among the soldiers and keeping the fae away from the borders, so searching for a wife is the least of his concerns, even if the Chain of Fate tugs at him. After a confrontation with a necromancer from the fairy kingdom, which results in his own deceased soldiers being sent to him, his flamboyant - yet always right, genderfluid, auncle Huri urges him to follow the Chain of Fate to protect Sera from the Fairy King.

His hands become tied when his father commands him to marry her, though Elek believes it has more to do with his father wanting to irritate his rival, King Jovan of Regnum When Elek first meets Sera, he is surprised by her naivety and impulsive acceptance of his proposal without asking any questions.

Soon after being bound to each other, they realize they were always meant to be together. They were always meant to have a life that they were denied when their ancient souls first roamed the world. With a sword in his hand and a gladius in hers, they are determined to show that dungeons and wars won't keep them apart, no matter what the Fairy King's plans are.

Curl up with this feel-good novel and join these two lovers as they learn what it is to have someone to live for.”

Published My First Book,"As of ten days ago I offically joined the ranks of  the self-published.

  
In the shadows, a different kind of light guides those who dwell within...

King Alasdair has ruled his kingdom with a darkness that others fear to tread. But when a powerful magical artifact falls into his hands, he becomes a hunted man, exiled to a world where gods walk among mortals.

In this strange new realm, he meets Selena, the youngest princess of the local royal family and a goddess of dreams. Mistaking Alasdair for a legendary pagan god who shares his name, Selena hopes he can help her solve the mystery of her parents' disappearance. Despite their differences, Alasdair is drawn to Selena's kindness, while she is captivated by the enigmatic figure who might be more than he seems.

Their tenuous bond is tested when a violent purge decimates the royal castle, leaving Alasdair and Selena falsely accused of treason. Forced to flee with a turncoat, a prideful maid, and a red squirrel, they are pursued by Selena’s own family. As they race toward the neighboring country of Urdane, Alasdair must decide whether to protect Selena or drag her into his shadows. But for Selena, the truth may be even more dangerous: Alasdair might be the god of legend—or something far more dangerous, a lover.

Relentless Blades! D&D-inspired Epic fantasy novel seeking ARC readers.,"Relentless Blades - D&D-inspired Epic Fantasy novel seeking ARC readers.

If you like D&D and enjoy fantasy novels, this book is for you!

Cross the wrong men and meet their blades!

In Zarune, peace hangs by a thread as the vragoths, once tyrannical rulers, hunger to reclaim their dominance. When an ancient scepter capable of tipping the balance of power is unearthed, they will stop at nothing to seize it.

Burdened by shame and hiding in a frontier town, Vigilanton never expected to stand against them. But when his estranged brother arrives to investigate the discovery, Vigilanton is forced to confront his past and take action. Joined by Grimlock—a half-skron driven by vengeance and haunted by guilt—they may be the realm’s only hope of stopping the vragoths.

As fates collide, unlikely allies engage in a deadly pursuit of these wicked fiends, while old grudges and past failures threaten to tear their fragile alliance apart. Time is running out, and each knows that failure will doom the land to the vragoths’ brutal reign.

It combines the thrilling adventure of Raiders of the Lost Ark with the gritty combat of Gladiator, all wrapped up in a fantastical world full of monsters and mayhem.

Introducing Libros.market: A Self-Publishing Platform for Latin American Authors,"Hi everyone!

I’m excited to introduce [**Libros.market**](http://Libros.market), a self-publishing platform specifically for **Latin American authors**. While platforms like Amazon KDP are great, they don’t have a strong presence in Latin America, making it harder for authors in the region to publish and sell their books through print on demand.

At [**Libros.market**](http://Libros.market), we’ve made it easier for Latin American authors to:

* **Publish their printed books** and distribute them in **Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, and Spain**.
* Enjoy **royalties and printing costs identical to Amazon KDP**, but with **monthly payments** and **no tax withholdings**.
* Retain full control of their book and pricing.

We offer a streamlined, local solution where Latin American authors can publish, sell, and receive their royalties with fewer hurdles.

If you’re interested in learning more, visit [**Libros.market**](https://libros.market). I’d be happy to answer any questions!

Book printing help,"I want to make a fine art book printed double sided. But I’m coming up with a lot of road blocks.

Plus if there was any issues or changes I’d have to wait for the book to be completed rather then do test prints. I opted for local fine art printers and book binder. One local printer told me they can’t do double sided pages because the registration won’t line up on the other side. 

My optimal paper would be

I’d love to use

First Time Author,"Hello, all. I've recently jumped, and decided to publish my first novel (first of three). I'm a first time author, and I'm not a massive name, so of course I don't have a book deal and I went with a ""self publishing"" company. This company is mega pushing me to have ""book insurance,"" to be able to promote to larger bookstores (i.e., Booksamillion, B&N). They are saying that if I don't have book insurance, that the bookstores won't be inclined to purchase copies to sell because they like to have the ""return"" option if it doesn't sell. I've tried researching this book insurance. I'm only finding media, basic, or professional liability insurance to cover copyright infringement or basic liability suits, and only for small businesses. 

My gut is telling me that they are pushing just for me to spend more money. They are telling me its imperative to spend this money so they can maximize my book visibility to all platforms. I think that if I market correctly, have my own website, and purchase my own insurance, that I'll be fine with them doing the bare minimum, and that's simply making sure that my book gets printed. 

My question is--has anyone heard of this book insurance? Does anyone have any experience with it? I want to make sure I'm giving myself my best chance and not selling myself short, while not spending anymore money than I have to.

My first Novella - Notes from Star to Star - Available for Free Download this Weekend (September 13-16),"I recently published my first novella, *Notes from Star to Star*, ton Amazon as a paperback and an ebook. It's the story of Jessica Hamilton, who wakes alone in space after a long hibernation. While the purpose of her mission — to investigate the origin of alien radio signals — quickly becomes clear, the circumstances surrounding her departure and the whereabouts of the rest of ship's crew present an unnerving mystery.

Hamilton quickly makes contact with the apparent source of the signals, but that leads to more questions than answers. As she hurtles towards her objective on a ship populated only by robots, Hamilton grapples with the meaning of connection, intelligence, and beauty — human and otherwise.

When the best time to fix typos in my print on demand book?,"I recently published a nonfiction book using Lulu. I‘ve already sold 60+ copies in Hardcover and Paperback. I‘ve already discovered an instance where I misspelled a photo contributor‘s name in a caption and a reader just reported an error in an image caption on page 2! How I typed „Indianapolis, Illinois“ is beyond me. 🤣 Regardless, my two editors, my husband and I all missed it. And I went over this book sooo many times. The image was a late add and I was rather frazzled by then.

Anyway, I can make the changes now, because it’s print on demand, but it requires re-uploading and double checking files 5 times. Which is 5 potential times something could go wrong. Should I wait until I have x number of mistakes to correct? A certain period of time? I’m looking for some input.

Now free on Amazon: Humans (+1): Hope’s Heart,"
Book overview:

Once a prisoner, confined in the depths of a sinister prison for what felt like an eternity, this
poor soul had his senses dulled, his voice silenced, and his memories stolen. However, within
the journey of his healing, he was narrated a poignant tale of a young innocent girl who, from
the moment of her birth, found herself imprisoned by a strange entity known as ‘The
Monster’.

The young girl managed to escape for the very first time, only to discover a world devoid of
human civilization, where peculiar creatures of mysterious origins now roam. In her daring
quest as the sole human, she embarks on a mission to aid the inhabitants of the heart realm,
combating unseen infections that threaten their existence.
Along the way, she will uncover the enigma behind the disappearance of humanity, while
also forging a deeper connection with her own humanity and unraveling the profound
mysteries of the human experience.",2,0,2024-09-06,FearTuner,Author,0.75

**Need Help: Should I Continue Writing My Book or Abandon the Dream?**,"Hey everyone,

I’ve recently started writing a book, but I’m at a crossroads and could really use some advice. I’m not sure if what I’m writing is good enough to continue or if I should abandon the dream of ever being good enough to publish. I’ve put a lot of time and effort into this project, but self-doubt is starting to creep in, and I’m struggling to see the potential in what I’ve created so far.

I would love some feedback on my writing—whether it’s the plot, characters, or even just the overall vibe of the story. I’m open to all constructive criticism, as I want to improve and grow as a writer.

Also, does anyone have any experience with publishing on Amazon? I’ve heard about Amazon’s self-publishing platform, but I’m not entirely sure how it works or if it’s a viable option for someone like me who’s just starting out.


Any advice would be appreciated!

Anyone have any recent Amazon KDP or IngramSpark experience with educational books that include illustrations with nudity?,"Hi y'all. I offer publishing services. I have a fairly extensive knowledge base, but I'm running into a question that I don't have a recent example to reference.

I have a client with an academic book (almost a textbook) that includes illustrations of genitalia. Nothing here is sexual and it's all for educational purposes.

This client talked to Amazon KDP and were told that they have to mark it as 18+, but that doesn't fit the advice I would normally give and doesn't fit my past experiences with educational materials. (And it wouldn't be the first time KDP staff gave advice that isn't always correct, so I don't know 100% that this specific support staff is correct or just interpreting the content guidelines too strictly). 

Anyway, it's been a couple of years since I've had a book like this one.

Help me self-publish and move on or abandon altogether...?,"Hi all-

I wrote a non-fiction/ self help book about five years ago.  I was working as an elementary school principal and the purpose was to help other new principals feel confident going into the role.  I was really excited about this project and got it completed!

The problem is...it just sat on my laptop for the last FIVE years.  I abandoned the project thinking it was stupid, no one was going to read it, etc.  I got tired of looking at the material and editing seemed daunting.  I also stopped working as a principal and moved onto coaching and leadership support. 

Now I just had two folks out of the blue ask me about this book, and I got inspired to just publish it already and have a few copies to give to friends, acquaintances who find themselves about to start a leadership role at a new school.  

On a whim, I signed up with Norman Publishing to just have someone else take on creating the book cover, editing and publishing as quickly as possible.  

My main goal was to just conclude this project already.  I don't really want to spend any more time on it then I already have.  I want to move onto other things.  

My issue is: I just don't have the same excitement or momentum for this book as I did when I started.  I have this all-around, negative, ""over it"" energy that is not helping anyone or anything, most of all myself.  I'm worried about self-publishing a piece of crap I'm not that enthusiastic about and just having that out there.  Is this self-sabotage at its finest?  I can't bring myself to try and get author's quotes for my cover to help promote it.  I think my all around confidence is just at an all time low. 

(FYI- I recently got laid off, so this is a big part of it too)

Is rushing through publishing really better than letting something I worked hard on continue to sit on my laptop?  I don't know.

I DO know that I really want to write a book.  But I want it to be a GOOD book, one that I am super excited to put out into the world, to promote, to talk about, to get everyone and anyone I meet to read...maybe even something that has nothing to do with education or leadership.  This is not it.  

Will having a self-published book that I'm not that psyched about end up being a liability for me in the long run when I finally make something GOOD?",7,8,2024-08-06,Business-Cucumber-91,N/A,0.89

Images in Amazon print paperback are too light ,"I created my book in PressBooks. The book contains black and white images. I began with very high quality, portrait size photos.

I made a goodreads/letterboxd alternative for reddit lit corners called literary.salon with future plans of expanding to self-publishing,"[https://www.literary.salon/](https://www.literary.salon/)

Reposting it here because it got a lot of traction in other lit subs! Currently at 650+ registered users + 150-200 daily active users. And no, the site is not monetized ;). A lot of the users told me I should post the site here.

It's essentially a letterboxd for literature, with emphasis on community and personalization. You can set your profile picture, banner image, and username which becomes your URL. You can also set a spotify track for your shelf. I took huge UI inspirations from Substack, Arena, and letterboxd. You have a bookshelf, reviews, quotes, and lists. You can set descriptions for each of them, e.g. link your are.na, reddit, or more. There's also a salon, where you can ask quick questions and comment on other threads. It's like a mini reddit contained within the site. You also have notifications, where you get alerted if a user likes your review, thread, list, etc. I want the users to interact with each other and engage with each other. The reviews are markdown-supported, and fosters long-formats with a rich text editor (gives writing texture IMO) rather than letterboxd one sentence quips that no one finds funny. The API is OpenLibrary, which I found better than Google books.

For example, here's my bookshelf: [https://www.literary.salon/shelf/lowiqmarkfisher](https://www.literary.salon/shelf/lowiqmarkfisher). It's pretty sparse because I'm so burnt out, but I hope it gets the gist across.

I tried to model the site off of real bookshelves. If you add a book to your shelf, it indicates that you ""Want to Read"" it. Then, there are easy toggles to say you ""Like"" the book or ""Read"" the book. Rather than maintaining 3 separate sections like GR, I tried to mimic how a IRL shelf works.

IMO Goodreads and even storygraph do not foster any sort of community, and most of all, the site itself lacks perspective and a taste level (not that I have good taste, but you guys do). This is one of my favorite book-related communities I've found in my entire life. The literary corners of reddit should be cherished and fostered. IMO every ""goodreads alternative"" failed due to the fact that they were never rooted in any real community. No one cares about what actual strangers read or write. You care about what people you think have better taste than you read and write. I am saying this tongue in cheek, but it's true IMO. I really do think we can start something really special in this bleak age of the internet where we can't even set banner images on our intimate online spaces. I also believe the community can set a taste level and a perspective that organically grows from a strong community. Now, when we post on reddit, we could actually look at what you read, reviewed, liked, etc. I hope it complements this sub well.

My future ambition is to make this site allow self-publishing and original writing. That would be so fucking awesome. Or perhaps a marketplace for rare first editions etc etc. Also more personalization. We'll figure it out. 

BTW, I made a discord so you can report bugs, or suggest features. Please don't be shy, I stared at this site so long that I've completely lost touch with reality. I trust your feedback more than my intuition. [https://discord.gg/VBrsR76FV3](https://discord.gg/VBrsR76FV3).",3,0,2024-07-25,lowiqmarkfisher,N/A,1.0

Need advice please ,"Hi! I'm brand new to this but I am wanting to write a short children's book in memory of my cat. 

Over the years I had come up with cute rhymes and poems about her because she was so unique and did funny things. 
Nieces and nephews loved it. I have it all written out and wanted to publish it so I can have copies for family and friends who also loved her. 

I can see most of you are writing novels, so i hope this doesnt sound silly. 
Someone suggested using amazon to publish kids books?

Free Ebook Scifi Fantasy ,"Hello everyone good morning I'm a self-published author, thrilled to announce the release of my debut book. It's an exciting moment for me, and I'm eager to share my work with all of you. I am promoting my ebook for those who use Barnes and Noble. The book will be free today from July 21st-31st and will be $2.99. The book is also available on Amazon.

In the year 2050, Earth-Prime is a world filled with superpowers known as gears, with Xavier Jones standing out as a young beacon of hope. He is endowed with unique gears, which manifest as bands on his arms and legs, with each possessing a unique ability, such as physical enhancements of speed, strength, and energy absorbing and releasing abilities, to name a few. Alongside his sister, who has shapeshifting abilities, and his friends, Xavier shoulders the mantle of leading the next generation of heroes against nefarious villains aiming to eradicate the world. Their path is rife with betrayal, heartbreak, and understanding of the meaning of true heroism. The villain Ravage and cohorts, driven by relentless determination, pose a consequential threat to our heroes. Can these young Heroes prevail?

scam alert,"I'm posting this in a couple different forums:



This has happened to me enough times in just the past few weeks for me to have noticed a pattern: 



Self published authors with pages on facebook might get invitations from ""established"" authors offering friend links. At first, the new ""friend"" expresses an interest in the writer, praises the writer's new work, asks what their ""process"" is, and what inspired them to write their most recent work. 

In one case, when I asked the ""author/friend"" about their process I got this description straight from ai:

* I draw inspiration from various sources for my writing. My motivations often include exploring complex human emotions, relationships, and the profound impact of personal histories on individuals. My writing delves deeply into the psychological and emotional landscapes of my characters, which reflects my interest in exploring the depths of human experience and resilience. My  background in journalism and my experiences traveling and living in different cultures also influence my storytelling, providing a rich tapestry of themes and narratives in my work.

After touching the writer's most vulnerable parts, the new ""friend"" then asks something along the line of 'what are you doing to promote your work? ... I have somebody who has done wonders for me ...' (ignoring the part that they're 

* 1) established 
* 2) prize-winning 
* 3) have a publisher doing all the promoting 
* 4) have an agent 

and proceeds to pitch a book promoter / marketer, whom you should immediately hire if you want to be famous just like them!

The move from ... you're a wonderful writer to why don't you hire this book promoter happens quickly, within the span of one short chat session.",13,3,2024-07-19,WorldlinessWeird711,N/A,0.93

Writing a Literary Fiction,"Hello! I am writing a literary fiction book from the perspective of my main character. It’s structured somewhat like a journal, though without specific dates. Do you enjoy reading books in this format? I'd appreciate your thoughts on the opening, which I've included below. Does it capture your interest, or would you be inclined to stop reading?

“My mother gifted me this journal, emphasizing the importance of documenting our history through writing. Luckily for me, I have a photographic memory; however, for future reference and in line with that heritage, I've inscribed our lost language at the back of this book. Over the past few decades, we've managed to decipher this forgotten language, uncovering insights into our past.

Allow me to introduce myself before delving into the tragic events that befell both me and my village. I'm Athena, hailing from a serene place known as Essealas, characterized by its lush greenery and vibrant blooms. As a Catrenian, I have dark red fur adorned with beige and yellowish spots cascading down my left side.”

Going direct w/Barnes & Noble: ISBN?,"I’m planning to publish directly with KDP and use D2D for pretty much everything else, EXCEPT I’ve seen the often repeated advice that if using D2D you should still go direct with B&N and Kobo. 

I went to the B&N site yesterday and discovered they won’t publish anything with an ISBN that has been assigned elsewhere. 

So does that mean making sure I hit publish with them first? Or to be safe should I assign a separate B&N-only ISBN?

Saw some discussion about how IngramSpark will publish with an ISBN that’s in use at B&N, so I’m wondering if D2D does? 

Sorta defeats the purpose of an ISBN to require your own, IMHO. ",3,7,2024-07-17,deemallon,N/A,1.0

Getting an ISBN,"I'm sorry if this is an obvious question, but I'm a little lost in the sea of people trying to sell me things.  I'm planning my launch through Kind Direct Publishing, and I'm just deciding how I should go about getting an ISBN.  I know KDP will provide one for free, but once I publish with that ISBN, my understanding is that I'll be stuck with it, only able to use KDP and never able to publish somewhere else.

1. Is this something I need to worry about?  Once its published with KDP, I struggle to imagine I would be able to market it to be published anywhere else.

2. If I decide I want to have my own ISBN to keep my options open anyway, is there a legit service anyone here would recommend?  Like many of us here, I imagine, I'm on a budget, so I'm just shopping my options.
