Do you think the way we read has changed more than the books themselves?,"I have been thinking about how my own reading habits have shifted over the years, and I wonder if others feel the same.

When I go back to older books, even classics that people have read for generations, I realize the words have not changed, but my way of engaging with them has.   
  
Growing up, I used to read slowly, re-reading passages, letting the story live in my head for weeks.   
  
Now, with so much digital content and endless scrolling, I notice I rush more. I look for fast payoffs, quick moments of impact, and I sometimes lose patience with slower sections.

It makes me wonder: are modern books really that different, or is it our attention that has changed?   
  
Are we demanding tighter plots and faster pacing because our own focus is fractured?   
  
Or do we just interpret older books through a different lens now, influenced by the way we consume media every day?

I would love to hear from you:

1. Have you noticed your reading style changing with time?
2. Do you think the shift is in the books being written today, or in us as readers?
3. And what do you do to slow yourself down and let a book breathe again?

Curious to hear how others see it.

Thank you.",240,107,2025-09-24,gamersecret2,N/A,0.92
Recommended by Dad?,"Are there any books your father asked you to read, because they were important to him? There were two for me, recommended when I was about 14.

The first was Dandelion Wine, Ray Bradbury's ode to boyhood. The second was, and still is, the most sentimental novel I have ever encountered: **Greenwillow, by B.J. Chute**.

It is set in a small town, somewhere outside of the flow of time, with two preachers. The stern Reverend Lapp, and Reverend Birdsong, who just shows up one day, full of sunshine and promise. There is also a seemingly doomed love story between Dorie, who will never leave the town, and Gideon, whose family curse will force him to wander. The story is tender, but full of humor too (and a toothless Granny who gnaws on raw turnips all day).

These two books showed me a softer side of my dad. Please tell me what books your father shared with you. But also, read Greenwillow -- it's a strange and wonderful book.",89,203,2025-09-25,Bellsar_Ringing,N/A,0.9
"North Woods by Daniel Mason, a review.","Just finished reading *North Woods*(2023) by Dr. Daniel Mason who is a psychiatrist, a literature professor at Stanford University and also does some excellent writing on the side. 

Just like the author, *North Woods* is a genre defying novel that eloquently spans 400 years of history in a small wooded clearing in Western Massachusetts. The premise is simple yet profound: A house built by two runaway lovers in the wilderness becomes the silent witness to the passing of time. Across generations, its walls shelter Puritan settlers, artists, fugitives, revolutionaries, farmers, scientists, dreamers and spectral presence(s). Their stories forgotten by people but remembered in vivid detail by the land. 

What makes the novel compelling is its structure. Instead of focusing on one protagonist, Mason lets the house itself bind the narrative. Each chapter shifts its form (eg. letters, songs, field notes, ghost stories), while also bringing a fresh kaleidoscopic perspective, sometimes through the eyes of human characters, other times from the experience of animals, insects or plants, lending the story an immersive ecological depth. The house in the woods becomes a living character itself, witnessing love, envy, betrayal and loss, embodying both sanctuary and confinement. The result is less about plot in the traditional sense and more about the interconnection of time, nature and the human experience. 

Mason's poetic prose skillfully blends historical fiction with elements of Gothic mystery and magical realism adding an otherworldly feel without overwhelming the grounded emotional reality of the characters. One of its strongest aspect is the seamless integration of human history with natural cycles, raising profound questions about the fragility and resilience of life. While the pacing may feel slow at moments due to its vast time span and reflective style, the book’s multi-voiced structure, literary ambition and deep empathy for its characters make it a strikingly original unforgettable reading experience, rich with insight and beauty.

Highly recommended for readers who love sweeping historical fiction, lyrical nature descriptions, ghostly atmosphere and inventive storytelling that lingers long after the last page. Daniel Mason has confirmed his status as a master storyteller in my heart with this profound and haunting work, definitely making the top 5 among the 50 odd books I have read this year.

"Going home: Theodore Sturgeon's ""A Way Home"".","Whelp, read my first ever collection of stories by Theodore Sturgeon! This one is a collection from the 50s titled ""A Way Home""

It's a very nice and tidy little collection of stories, at least about in total. Most of the stories in this collection are on the longish side, novellas of course, and there were at least a couple of shorter ones too. And all nine of them were pretty good!

Sturgeon is one of those writers of the golden age that I've never read before, but was very interested in his work. And when I got to read one of his stories in Ellison's ""Dangerous Visions"", I pretty much wanted to read more of his stuff, and so I began to keep an eye out for his stuff whenever I'm in a used book store.

Best way I can describe Sturgeon's style as writerly. Probably not in the sense of mainstream fiction, but more in the sense of a few other golden age writers like Ray Bradbury and Henry Kuttner, so something more along the lines of stylist. Very easy to see him as an influence to New Wave SciFi that would come a decade later, as he mixes both action and social commentary into his stories.

He's written a few novels (and I love to get my hands on some of those!) but he's much more well known for his short stories as there are quite a lot of collections! If I ever see another of his collections, or at least one of his novels, I'm swooping in and picking it up!",3,1,2025-09-25,i-the-muso-1968,N/A,0.67

Boy's Life is is an instant classic.,"Wow. This book. Just wow. Boy's Life is one of the most magnificent books I've ever read, and might be the best book I've read this year. McCammon has written a masterpiece that should stand next to the best coming of age books ever written. Heck, in my opinion, this is a book that could be read in literature classes because of the depth it has with its themes. Boy's Life is a beautiful book, oftentimes bizarre, but magical the entire time. About 30 pages into the book, I already had the feeling that this one was going to be special, and the book proved me correct. Boy's Life pulls elements from a lot of different places: it has elements of southern gothic like Flannery O'Connor, coming of age themes and concepts of race and human dignity like in To Kill A Mockingbird, and also moments of horror similar to Stephen King. One of my favorite parts about this book was this overwhelming sense of nostalgia and childhood that suffuses the entire novel. I found myself reflecting on my own childhood and what it means to grow up, and wow, so many of the scenes just kept sticking with me the entire time I read this and they'll continue to stay with me long after. McCammon's character development is on a masterclass level here, his prose is stunning and is capable of weaving so many threads together, there are many emotional moments and I was moved to tears multiple times during my read, and I don't even know what else to say other than I LOVED this book. If you like coming of age tales at all, this is an absolute must read. Boy's Life gets my absolute highest recommendation.",149,49,2025-09-23,laudida,N/A,0.89

Rereading Wuthering Heights in 2025 is so disappointing…,"I read this book as a teenager and thought I had fond memories of it, possibly I had over romanticised the story.  With the new film coming out soon, I decided to reread it and was astonished to find it is melodramatic nonsense, that all the characters are extremely dislikable, it portrays extremely abusive relationships, that Heathcliff is a toxic, violent bully and that the female characters are portrayed as victims and spoilt princesses with a tragic fate.  Don’t get me started on these vague illnesses and deaths that half the characters suffer conveniently or the patronising way the working class servants are written.  The entire story is as bleak as the landscape it is set in.  This could put me off rereading classics.  What is your opinion of this book in 2025?",0,35,2025-09-25,Verystrange129,N/A,0.43
Faulkner’s “Sanctuary”: overrated?,"I just couldn’t feel there was anything of value gained by reading this book. On just about every level. But it’s what made Faulkner’s name, so apparently not everyone is as repulsed as I was.

One of my first objections was the characters’ tendencies to not complete their thoughts.  The book required a LOT of reading between the lines. As far as I can tell, this was the only novel aspect of his literary style, but I didn’t care for it. 

One of the protagonists in the story, the “fast girl” Temple, spends the first half of the book running in panic from one bedroom to another, and the second half of the book getting alternately raped and then drunk. 

The other protagonist, the ineffectual lawyer Horace, misjudges everyone and everything in the murder case he gets sucked into. 

By the end of the novel both Horace and Temple go away, and neither of them seems to care about what they went through. 

Faulkner himself once dismissed the novel as a “potboiler.” Is it anything but? What am I missing?",0,5,2025-09-25,cja1968,N/A,0.36
Feeling a lot like 2018 tonight,"It's feeling a lot like 2018 tonight as I find myself enjoying the pages of INJUSTICE: GODS AMONG US VOL 2 issue #2 in which Kalibak opens a boom tube above Superman, out of which pours more Apokolips warriors than I can count. (Something tells me things won't end well for Kalibak though, and I don't expect Kalibak to be surviving long enough to appear in issue #3.)

Having never played the INJUSTICE video game, I do find it interesting to actually be reading comic books based on a video game I never played, while the tale being told in the comic books begins five years prior to the tale in the video game. When it comes to being a reader, I suppose there really is a first time for everything. 

I'm really enjoying these INJUSTICE comic books overall. I already sort of knew that I would, because Taylor writes cool stuff. I wonder which other tales of his I ought to be on the lookout for.",0,4,2025-09-25,SonnyCalzone,N/A,0.23

Libra by Don Delillo - Is there a deeper message being conveyed?,I just finished reading Libra by Don Delillo which I thought was great!

"""Lost Horizon"" - what I didn't notice as a kid","I just reread ""Lost Horizon"" (the book that introduced Shangri-La, an almost-magical Tibetan Buddhist monastery hidden from the world) for the first time since high school. It was incredibly popular book from 1933 when it was written up through the 70s, when I read it and it was adopted by the New Age movement.

I was startled at its aura of Kipling's ""take up the white man's burden"" that seemed perfectly reasonable to me at the time. 

Sometimes re-reading books casts an unflattering light on your own past.


Spoiler: 

The monastery was founded by a Frenchman and German, run by a Frenchman, and he decides to hand it over to a British guy who's been there for a few months rather than the locals who've been studying for decades to be monks, because Chinese and Tibetan people don't have the right attitude. There's a lot of talk about music but it's entirely about European composers, often using a harpsichord and a grand piano hauled in over the Himalayas by native porters.

The fact that I accepted all this as reasonable says something about my attitude at the time, which I think reflects society's attitude at the time. I hope my attitude has changed even if that of parts of society haven't.

It goes without saying that all the major characters are men except one sexually repressed British missionary for comic effect and a sexy young Chinese girl who acts as a love-interest McGuffin.

Sloppy editing,"I just finished a contemporary romantasy which will remain nameless.  The author is a New York Times bestselling author with a stack of previous novels under her belt.  This book was put out by a mainstream publisher (Ace).  It was a fun book, well plotted, engaging, no complaints on that score.  But the line editing was….lacking.  There were a couple of times where I’m pretty sure a line of dialogue was included twice within a couple of pages by mistake (once I even thought ‘is there a time travel component to this?’ because the scene seemed to skip backwards.  And the prose had a bunch of minor grammatical errors which are the type of thing that people say when speaking colloquially but aren’t usually seen in this type of writing (first person, past tense, straight up, nothing experimental). I mean along the lines of ‘having been’ used in the  ‘wrong place’. Not egregiously wrong but enough that as I was reading I took out my mental red pen and rewrote lines multiple times.

I recently read a bestselling leadership book in a second edition that had a number of similar errors, definitely things that should have been caught before going to press.

What’s up?  Is this the way things are now, and if an author want a decently edited book they have to make sure it happens on their own?  Or is it just a coincidence that I’ve hit two books like this in a row?",74,54,2025-09-22,FlipDaly,N/A,0.8
"Lonesome Dove, lonesome now","60F UK female here who loves to read books considered classics. This kept popping up as one that must be read. Had given this a swerve though as it’s about cowboys and ranches and horses and so on and so on. Eventually took the plunge based on reviews on Reddit. 
Have just finished it. What a book!!! I actually feel a little bereft that it’s over. 
What this novel demonstrated for me (amongst other things) is it really doesn’t matter when you live, where you live and what your circumstances are, human nature with all its foibles, its meanness, its random acts of kindness is the same wherever you are. 
The richness of these characters, the incredible narrative, the shock of some of the happenings. This is one book that will stay with me forever.

What are your favorite banned/controversial books?,"Depending on where you live, it might be hard to actually read banned or controversial books, but if you've read any - what book stood out to you? 

I enjoy reading books that are controversial or banned in other countries, I believe they are important to read - partly because no book should be banned and partly because it is the controversial topics that usually lead to a difference, be it in society or in your way of thinking. I also enjoy reading them because it is a way for me to practice my freedom of information and speech. 

I've read some of the classics, such as Catcher in the Rye, some George Orwell, Farenheit 451, Metamorphosis, a lot about the Holocaust and I started reading 120 Days of Salo but didn't finish it (language was hard to read). While I did enjoy them all and found them important to read (maybe arguably not Salo), I kind of already knew what they were about so I wasn't too surprised at the plot (except Metamorphosis - had no idea what it was about, definitely more fun reading when I had no idea what to expect). 

Are there any banned/controversial books you've read that you've found to be very rewarding? Or maybe a book you enjoyed a lot and later found out that it is banned or deemed controversial in another country? ",98,183,2025-09-22,Funkiebastard,N/A,0.79

The Remains of the Day - Kazuo Ishiguro,"It took me a long time to finish this book. And don’t take me wrong, Kazuo Ishiguro’s prose has a very good flow and is very dynamic; however, the topic was not *it.* His style of writing is very easy to read and follow, but the book itself never grabs you.

This book is Mr. Stevens’ memoir written during his 3-day trip along the English country. Mr. Stevens is an old-fashioned butler in a post-war house in England. It could be said that he was the best butler of his time: a devoted butler who sacrificed everything in his life to make sure he was doing his job with dignity and to serve his lord. He was extremely proud of his job as a butler and of the state the house was at. He even believed he had an impact in the world-affairs: big world leaders would meet at Darlington Hall to make decisions regarding the war, and Mr. Stevens believed details such as the silverware affected this meetings. He rejected a family to serve his lord, and was even humiliated in a couple of occasions. He was often made fun of by the leaders that visited the house, just to prove that the everyday man is dumb. And instead of being humiliated he felt proud of being able to serve his lord. His sacrifice went as far as to keep serving his lord the day that Mr. Stevens’ father passed away. When the doctor came to see his dad, Mr. Stevens insisted the doctor should take care of one of the guests of the banquet instead.

The book revolves around Mr. Stevens’ reflexions about what being a good butler is, all things he did as a butler that make a difference between a good butler and a bad butler. The book gets tedious when the butler describes in detail his staff organization, the special dust-sheeting the unoccupied wings should get, the handmaids shifts, and so on.

Apparently Darlington Hall was one of the most successful houses in the prewar period. However, Lord Darlington fell out of the grace of the public eye when his relationships with the Germans were discovered during the war (apparently he was trying to get Hitler and the prime minister to meet). Stevens was such a loyal servant that when hinted about this, he believed his Lord Darlington was right and people just could not understand it. After the war ended, Lord Darlington passed away and the house was bought by an American Mr. Faraday. Mr. Faraday did not have as much guests as Lord Darlington back in the day, so the job was easier. Nevertheless, Stevens started noticing he was committing more mistakes, and it should be added that they were really small mistakes, not noticed by Mr. Faraday. But Stevens is an over-analyst, and however small the mistake was, he would analyze it to death. He noticed how Faraday would make comments expecting a witty response or banter from Stevens, and Stevens not being used to that would be silent. So Stevens started practicing his “witticisms” daily.

The real action of the book is Stevens trip driving his boss’s Ford to Cornwall to visit the former Darlington Hall housekeeper, Miss Kenton. Miss Kenton was Stevens’ colleague, and he made sure to keep the relationship a working one. Apparently she tried to flirt with Stevens and admired him, but he was just to busy to notice. Eventually she met Mr. Benn and left after marrying him.

After a three day trip they meet in Cornwall at a hotel, and Miss Kenton tells Stevens about her marriage, how she didn’t love Mr. Benn at first, but she was running out of time to marry and have children. After having her daughter, she started loving her husband and being happier. But she still thinks about what could have been if her and Stevens had been a thing. The purpose of the trip was also to try and convince Miss Kenton to go back to Darlington Hall to work, since her letters made it seem like she had problems in her marriage. But it turned out everything was ok.

The climax of the book comes at the end, when Mr. Stevens is thinking and sees the lights turn on giving a beautiful spectacle. Someone tells him the evening is the best part of the day, and everyone is waiting for the evening to see the lights. He starts talking with someone, and tells him how he gave everything for Lord Darlington, and how now he was starting to commit mistakes. The person he was talking to told him to just enjoy, as he was now in the most expected part of the life: the evening, so he should embrace and live the remains of the day.",0,40,2025-09-24,LiterallySagan,N/A,0.44
My thoughts on the rest of The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro,"This book has left me with a lot of feelings that are difficult to really put words to. It’s rare that I encounter something so inherently irritating to me but still so intriguing. When I read the first chapter of the book I felt like this book would not be for me. I described these feelings in a previous reddit post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ni9nx5/my_thoughts_on_the_prologue_of_the_remains_of_the/)). However, and almost in spite, I kept reading and could not put it down. I wanted to see what was up with this silly butler, and what antics his utter devotion to his job would get him into. It really goes to show how impressive Ishiguro is that he keeps the reader so enticed, even through these negative feelings. The back of the book does little, I believe, to really prepare you for the contents of it. This book isn’t just a short trip through the English countryside. It’s a deep introspection on this particular man’s life, and how his personal philosophy and dedication to his role as a butler shapes the rest of his existence. When reading the comments on my last reddit post. I got the sense that he would “learn something” by the end of the book, that he would somehow change as a character. Guys, he doesn’t really change at all. His last few lines still show that he is first and foremost a butler, and that any personal interest he has must first be sieved by his butler role. There are hints here and there that maybe he will change, but it seems evident that he will continue to rely his personal self worth in how good of a butler he is or isn’t. 

There are some truly beautiful parts of this book. I found that the most interesting, engaging parts were when his butler duties were put in conflict against what would seem to be his personal interests. The best example of this are his recollections of some of his proudest days in the Salisbury chapter. In this chapter he pushes through the emotional turmoil from his complicating relationship with Ms. Kenton and his father dying of  a stroke to serve guests who could have a large impact on world affairs. He seems to associate this as his proudest day because, in spite of his beloved father dying and diminishing relationship with his good friend Ms. Kenton, he fulfills his role as a butler exceptionally. This chapter blew me away. It describes the utter dedication Mr. Stevens has to his work, the seemingly valid reasons for why he lives that way, and the tragedy that is being unable to tend to his own personal affairs in sacrifice to his work. 

I like this book. I do not like the main character. I sympathize and root for him however. I want him to live a happy life. I want him to find fulfillment. The way he chooses to seek fulfillment is through his dedication to his role. I think he is extremely misguided, but I still wish him the best. I got really pissed off in the way he ended his cocoa relationship with Ms. Kenton, even when she tried to reignite this routine with him, he stubbornly pushed away one of the only close friends he had for almost nothing. It was pure stupid, and hardly even in the interest of “being a good butler.” I think a lot of people who read this book don’t seem to feel me on this point. I think it’s okay to admit that Mr. Stevens is a pathetic, misguided, silly little guy. In fact, I’m almost sure that this is the point. We are supposed to feel sorry for him, and maybe decide that his lifestyle is not one that we want to partake in.

I think part of me feels that this book isn’t meant for me. I’m not the audience the author wanted to reach. I don’t subscribe to the old ways of English classism, I’m not one to dedicate myself so fully to a role that I lose myself in it. I don’t really feel like I’m walking away from this book having learned something important or profound. I’m just thankful that I am already the way that I am. The book was worth the read though. Its technique and style is really something to behold, and will be something I compare future books to. 

8/10. Would waste my time on this book again.

Notes on an execution!! Waait this was supposed to focus on women?,"Okay I finished this a few weeks ago and forgot to write a review but I have four opinions.


1. How beautifully suspenseful
2. Woaaah what pretty writing
3. Wait this is supposed to focus on the women? 
4. This is more fantasy than I expected—


I shall focus on 3 and 4 because 1 and 2 speak for themselves.
Okay so the book is very much marketed as being focused on the women the serial killer affected. This…is not true. There are four different viewpoints. The serial killer’s mom, his wife’s sister, a girl he met in his childhood, and naturally, his. Impressively, they all revolve around the serial killer! The irony lies in the fact that the book has FOUR women’s POVs and a single man’s. A book is usually about the guy who shows up the most often and obviously that’s the serial killer the book definitely isn’t about—-I just found that vaguely amusing. Either it’s a marketing error or the author is in denial. Also, in case you’re wondering, Ansel definitely is more fleshed out than all the female characters combined. >! Also!! Once again contrary to the message of the book, he did in fact go out with more fanfare than he deserved. Poor Blue. girly got so roped in. !<


Okay, four! It’s not actually fantasy worry not, but also?? What was that business about (minor spoiler I wouldn’t even consider it a spoiler actually) >! This brother screaming in my guy’s head? !< I know pretty little about mental health disorders and I accept that completely, but it literally made the serial killer another tortured man after all that work trying to make the book focus on the women that guy hurt. It’s like it was trying to add (very unneeded) ambiguity that would’ve been better in one of those women’s POVs the book was supposedly supposed to focus on. What exactly was that screaming thing based on anyway? Do tell if anybody has a reason for this cause I cannot think of a single reason that was a half decent idea, unless it was based on a real life scenario which I don’t think it is. 


ANYWAY other than that, it was a super fun read and I liked it! Four stars :)))))",4,6,2025-09-23,Immeandawesome,N/A,0.53
"Between Two Fires by Christopher Buehlman, a review.","Just finished *Between Two Fires*(2012) by Christopher Buehlman, a grim historical fantasy drama horror set in 14th century France, at the height of the Black Plague. 

The story follows a disgraced knight, a mysterious young girl and a struggling priest as they travel through a landscape ravaged not just by disease and war, but by the intrusion of demonic forces. Buehlman blends real medieval history with supernatural horror, creating a world where humanity’s suffering mirrors a cosmic battle between heaven and hell. It is dark, atmospheric and firmly rooted in medieval brutality. Full disclosure: The book goes heavy on religious Christian themes. 

Buehlman’s prose is one of the book’s biggest strengths. He writes with a lyrical poetic touch that still manages to capture the grit and filth of the era. The characters are written with enough depth, warmth, humanity and biting humour that its easy to become emotionally invested in their struggles even amid the bleakness of the world around them. Dialogue feels authentic without being overly archaic and his descriptions of both the plague-ridden countryside and moments of supernatural terror are vivid and haunting. The pacing and tone are deliberately uneven, certain passages are dense and slow, making the raw and shocking moments stand out. 

Pick it up if you are drawn to dark, atmospheric tales that mix history with the supernatural, where diseased landscapes, questions of faith and glimpses of hope intertwine. Its not flawless, on a couple occasions the book does stumble under the weight of its ambition, but its vivid writing, memorable characters and unsettling blend of horror and humanity make for a compelling rewarding read.

Just read The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest hemingway,"Normally, I like the books that has too much sadness, inner conflicts and situations that makes you feel there is no way out and all the life has to offer is endless pain and suffering. (recommend me books of this sort, please...)

But when my friend gave me this book, I didn't think much. I thought it's some nice, normal story about the old man and his struggles but it was nothing like that.

I can't say that this is the saddest book that I have read but it's sad enough if one can imagine the pain of his bad luck even though he likes to strike it off with humour and I like how the book ended. It is realistic. Santiago has it hard and I deeply respect and admire such people who are never recognised by society but suffers a lot.",276,73,2025-09-21,vinay1668,N/A,0.91
Dick Francis makes the horse-racing world come alive,"I just finished reading Longshot, published in 1990. I have a huge collection of Dick Francis books, but somehow missed reading this one until today. My first introduction to this outstanding author was as a teenager. The book was titled Nerve, and was one of four novels in a Reader’s Digest condensed book. Mr Francis is incredibly knowledgeable, and even though Murder is usually part of the plot, his descriptions are magical and his characters are realistic and sympathetically written.

"Which Childhood Novels Taught You About A Moment In History (and incidentally, where did you first learn the word ""pogrom""?)","I think I learned everything I know about history from the books I read growing up. I know I did history in a British high school but I can't remember much of what we studied except the jovial history teacher laughing ""The Cavaliers were wrong but romantic. Roundheads were right but not romantic"". I learned about the French Revolution and Napoleon from *Desiree,* about the American Civil War from *Gone With the Wind*, and *North and South,* and I believe my first introduction to WWII was through *The Silver Sword,* and then of course, *Goodnight Mr Tom,* and then *The Machine Gunners*. Yeah we did a lot of WWII in school too, but I literally cannot remember any of it expect that the British were awesome and the Nazis were evil. Versailles.

*Voyage.* By Adele Geras. I must have been thirteen back then. It followed the fourteen days on a transatlantic ship carrying Jews fleeing the violent anti-Semitism of East Europe, heading to a new life and hope in America. That's where I learned what pogroms were, I only remembered this the other day because on a different Reddit thread, people were discussing where they first learned about this word, and I thought back, and I remembered this book.

 damn, I wish that book had half as much acclaim and fame as goddamn *Titanic.*

I can't actually remember if the text of the story itself contains this word, or whether it appears in the description. The story certainly has very awful and very vivid descriptions of actual pogroms and murders which has stuck with me to this day. Actually, the old paperback copy is on the windowsill of my son's bedroom, yellowing and curling, one of my handful of precious childhood books that I brought with me to Canada after leaving my beloved but volatile home country, so I can probably go check. I could do that right now, I guess.",90,179,2025-09-21,1000andonenites,N/A,0.8

Just read Castle in the Air (howl's moving castle 2) and it was pretty good.,"About two-thirds of the story is about a man named Abdullah who goes on a quest to save a princess with a magic carpet. So I thought the story was going to be like Aladdin, especially since he even gets himself a genie. I was also a little disappointed that the main characters from the previous book weren’t in it. But since it’s set in the same world, I assume we would see them later.and I was wrong, turns out they were always hidden under my nose, i just couldn’t see them. The author really hid them well, it's a really good plot twist. I was honestly shocked by it.

Overall, it was a good read, and I’m going to try the third one when I have more time.",126,23,2025-09-20,thetruememeisbest,N/A,0.95
Okay A Little Life is mildly overrated—,"I read it yesterday and while I did ALMOST shed a tear (if I was being more cynical I probably wouldn’t have even winced but I was in the mood for crying), I almost instantly forgot all about it! And considering the emotional reaction it produces is the only strength of the book beyond writing strong friendships between two of the characters and abandoning the rest, this thing isn’t really that impressive? Which is depressing(more depressing than the book ngl) cause every person I’ve seen rate it rated it like 5000 thousand stars and called it their favourite book of all time.


Basically there’s a difference between summoning tears and actually being a good book, a differentiation a ton of people seem to cheerfully miss—- probably because no book would be five stars in that cause, and fair enough, but also idk I didn’t want to read this and why did so many people say it was g o o d cause I *reaaaally* didn’t want to read this—


Not to mention ending at any point before the actual end would’ve improved it cause wow is that a depressing ending with no actual point. I would’ve even taken a sudden stop without any explanation because half my issue with this thing, beyond no friendship development (I won’t mention the trauma being unrealistic because I suppose it is possible if you have very bad luck like REALLY bad luck and idk enough about that to rebut it), is that the overall message made by the ending of the book just. doesn’t exist? And if it does, it’s *wrong* like the message is literally *wrong* which is arguably worse. 


Anyway ew I rated it 3 stars because the writing is pretty and Harold is cool and anything less would’ve been me being resentful of the ending but also not saying the ending doesn’t deserve that??

The 'Westmark Trilogy' by Lloyd Alexander,"If Lloyd Alexander is remembered for anything, it's probably his *Chronicles of Prydain* series; a pioneering cycle of children's fantasy novels based on Welsh mythology. Famous for its whimsical humor, solid storytelling and incredible characters, the first book was released in 1964 (one year before Tolkien's *The Lord of the Rings* would officially be published in paperback and launching a global phenomenon) and was concluded in 1968 (with some supplemental material interspersed). Both the second volume (*The Black Cauldron*) and the final volume (*The High King*) won the Newbery Award for best children's literature (don't worry, no dogs die in them). It also, rather notoriously, was the inspiration for Disney's animated box office bomb *The Black Cauldron* (though I love that movie to bits).

But Alexander was a prolific author, and he wrote dozens of other books over his career. In particular, he wrote a trilogy of quasi-fantasy/quasi-historical novels called the *Westmark* trilogy.

These three books may very well be Alexander's crowning achievement in literature for young people, and yet it sadly did never get the recognition of *Prydain* (though the first book, *Westmark*, did win the National Book Award for children). It takes place in what can only be described as 'not-France' (called Westmark) during the twilight years of the 'not-Ancien Regime', where the people are becoming increasingly fed up with their stodgy and corrupt monarchy. Revolution is in the air, and a young printer's devil named Theo gets caught up with a group of con artists after nearly killing a King's Inspector in a scuffle. At the same time, the aging and grieving King (who has not gotten over the apparent death of his daughter) is being manipulated by his Chief Minister (named Cabbarus) into conceding more and more power to him, while the Queen and her court physician are actively attempting to curtail Cabbarus's schemes.

Then Theo and his group come across a charismatic republican activist named Florian, and things get *really* interesting.

What's so astonishing about these books is their ideological and moral depth: the nature of violence and its morality in the service of freedom and political change is a constant theme that comes about. Florian, a staunch liberal and republican, is convinced that the monarchy is stifling their country and actively holding it back from progressing, and he views a violent conflict between the Monarchy and the people as an inevitability. The Queen's physician, a man named Doctor Torrens, is a staunch conservative and monarchist who, while acknowledging the crimes of Cabbarus in the King's name, simply cannot let go of the centuries of culture and perceived stability that the monarchy provides. Both men are portrayed as morally good, and both are allowed to give equally compelling arguments on their stances. 

Then things get serious in the second volume, when the neighboring state of Regia invades. We get several scenes of war, and for children's literature it is *grim*. Alexander himself served on the Western Front during WWII, and he brings a degree of realism that is, quite frankly, shocking in its down-to-earth yet compassionate approach. Even when the revolution happens and we get a Robespierre-like figure named Justin, even he is not portrayed as wholly evil (because in spite of everything, he isn't *wrong)*.

And remember: these are *children's books* I've been talking about.",86,12,2025-09-20,Adonisus,N/A,0.99
Anti authoritarian books,"B&N in my city has a nice prominent section full of all these types of books on display so you can get all your anti-authoritarian lit in one place. Some good ones I’d recommend:

they thought they were free (Mayer)

This is a great book. A journalist travels to post Nazi Germans to interview 10 normal dudes in a small town from different walks of life, seeking to understand how/why Germans fell to Hitler. It’s very unsettling and candid and demonstrates how there are no easy or satisfying conclusions. It does a good job showing you just how easy it is to become a bystander or even complicit when you’re just a normal person just with life.

the origins of totalitarianism (Arendt)

This is more of an academic study on the process of an authoritarian takeover. Literally nothing we are seeing now is new.

diary of a man in despair  (Reck)

This is a very personal recounting of a Prussian aristocrat who lived (and died, when the journal was discovered) in Nazi germany. He was an old school conservative and not really a fan of democracy or activist or anything like that, he just really, really hated Nazis/Hitler because of how they perverted society and destroyed traditions. A good short read for those coming from a centrist or conservative perspective.

on tyranny (Pinketty)

This is maybe the one you should get if you can get only one; it’s digestible and sources many primary documents to give you the hard lessons and anecdotes on what to do in the situation we presently find ourselves in.

There were many more books as well, but these are the ones I’d recommend. Read them and share so that we don’t waste the benefit of having historical context and hindsight.",260,64,2025-09-19,airbear13,N/A,0.84
Anna Karenina - I have mixed feelings after reading this novel,"I can start by saying that I really enjoyed this book and Tolstoy really nailed it when it comes to conveying all the emotions each character expresses, making them all feel real (The ice skating scene where Levin acted awkward around Kitty was so relatable lol). I also love how he portrayed the aristocratic society of Russia, the fancy balls, the social dynamics and the way he presented the scandals and gossip happening within.

The story itself was truly a journey. Tolstoy built the characters up with deep psychological understanding, precisely capturing their desires, problems, and their emotional connections towards one another. Like Anna, for example, started off as a respected woman in the society but as her story progressed, and the consequences of her actions (like the affair she had with Vronsky) came into fruition, she spiraled into a world of jealousy and delusion which deteriorated her mentally and ultimately led to her suicide (at a train station too, where she first met Vronsky, this really impressed me for some reason). The way Tolstoy wrote it had me sympathizing for her, he made me understand her point of view, even though I found some of her actions quite questionable like her rejecting the divorce Karenin offered when he even said that he was willing to do whatever would make her happy, even willing to give up his son for it (if I remember this part correctly), but I guess it was just her emotions getting the best of her.

However, as much as I enjoyed the story, I'd be lying if I said this book had no flaws. When I first started reading, I initially assumed that it would be centered around Anna. And it kind of was I guess, but it just really surprised me how a huge portion of the book focuses on Levin, which isn't really that bad I guess, I like Levin's character, he's relatable, a socially awkward fellow who overthinks just about everything, like me. What disappointed me about Levin though (or the story in this case) was the amount of farming talks that didn't really tickle my fancy. I guess it was good to have some perspective on things like that, but for a book that seemed to focus on Russian aristocratic society during that era, I feel like Tolstoy went a bit too detailed when it came to the agricultural portion of the book,.

Another thing I'd like to mention was how disappointing the ending was. The build-up of Anna's story was really well-constructed and the suspense kept growing as Anna herself descends into an emotional and mental deterioration, but the moment she commits suicide, that was it. I guess we did get a glimpse of how it affected Vronsky and it obviously devastated him, but that was all there is to it. I expected part 8 to be all about her death and the reactions of certain characters, especially Karenin, their child Seyrozha (That was his name I think), Darya and even Kitty. But instead, it was like Anna served her purpose and was immediately set aside for Levin and his philosophical questionings and existential crisis, which isn't that bad in itself because I do kind of enjoy watching him contemplate about life, but still it sucked because it wasn't the ending I (or I assume everybody else) expected. Now that I mentioned Levin, anyone else feel like his brother's death was more explored than this?

This was also my first time reading Tolstoy so I'm not sure if this is his typical writing style but it left me heartbroken :( I was deeply impressed by the emotional weight Anna’s character was carrying, but was left unsatisfied by how sudden she was set aside. But above all, I enjoyed the book. It was an adventure, a journey through the lives of unique and interesting characters and how they've progressed throughout the story. However, as I neared the ending, I couldn't help but feel really disappointed. The emotional momentum was built so intensely, but the final chapters didn’t quite deliver the ending I was hoping for.

So a question to those who've read the book, what did you think of the book after you've read it? I would really like to hear your opinions.",65,67,2025-09-20,RecordWell,N/A,0.77
The Divine Comedy - Is it normal to feel detached from everything being said or am I missing something?,"Sorry if this is dumb, but for reference, I'm reading John Ciardi's Translation of the Divine Comedy. I'm on Canto XXXII of Inferno: Circle Nine. And while I find it funny at times, I feel very detached from it all. I do not believe in any of this so that may contribute to my attitude but I have grown up in the US South so I have some cultural/religious reference. 

But I see people online raving about how it makes them feel and I just feel like I'm missing something. I do have depression but I don't seem to have this problem with other books, usually. People are being mauled and burned and having horrible things happen to them and I just don't feel anything about it. 

TL;DR: What is your experience with Dante's Divine Comedy? Is it normal to be very detached from it or do I need a better translation or something else? 

Thanks!

"When you find what you like in a book, do you try to only read that thing or keep your horizons broadened?","The title sounds a bit clunky so let me explain. I recently discovered I like books set in a fantastical setting with a romantic subplot. I just finished a whole series and then finished another book like that and loved both so, so much.

I was given a bunch of recommendations based on my prompt which I’m going through since it’s the only type of book I want to read right now. However, I don’t want myself to be “burnt out” of this kind of novel from reading it so much. I’m reading a book from the same author but different series, and I’m wondering if I’m not seemingly enjoying it because it was her first (?) series, if I don’t like the premise in general, or if I’m reading too much of what I already enjoy, and it doesn’t feel “special” anymore.

So when you read and know what you like, do you actively just seek out that kind of book, or do you try to vary it to not get bored? Obviously, I’m not saying you should read books that don’t interest you, but are you reaching out for different genres?",28,68,2025-09-19,kuhteen,N/A,0.77

"Review for Unbound: A Woman’s Guide to Power by Kasia Urbaniak, a former dominatrix and Taoist nun.","Just finished Kasia Urbaniak’s *Unbound: A Woman’s Guide to Power* (2020) which is a transformative and provocative masterclass in reclaiming one's voice and agency. Her unique background as a former dominatrix and Taoist nun brings to the table a truly fresh perspective on power, which she defines not as dominance over others, but as the skillful ability to influence conversations and situations by mastering the flow of attention. 

What makes this book so compelling is its balance: it doesn't push aggression or manipulation, but instead teaches you how to hold power calmly, directly and authentically. Urbaniak shows how to move through the “freeze” response, ask clearly for what you want, and treat rejection as information rather than humiliation. I love how actionable the techniques are for transforming passive frustration into active pursuit and channeling emotions like rage into fuel for growth, which are applicable in every real life scenario. 

The book empowers without preaching. Urbaniak’s tone is warm, humorous and compassionate, making the lessons feel like guidance from a mentor rather than rules from a textbook. Her mix of storytelling, somatic practices and psychology resonates with anyone who has ever felt silenced, overlooked or hesitant to take up space.

While the anecdotes, examples and exercises have narrative that is addressed exclusively to women, the core principles are applicable to everyone. For men in particular, *Unbound* has surprising value. It dismantles the myth that you always have to be “in control” or have all the answers, showing instead that moments of doubt can be turned into strength. It teaches how to communicate with clarity and presence, build authority without hostility and how to form and strengthen connections. Most importantly, it presents a small window for men to observe the ongoing challenges women face while expressing their voice providing an opportunity to understand them better. 

Ultimately, *Unbound* is not just a book about women reclaiming power, its a guide for anyone who wants to step into their voice, set boundaries with confidence and engage authentically with others. Its a rare blend of practical, psychological and embodied wisdom that leaves you feeling stronger and more connected.

My particular response to Never Let Me Go (Spoilers),"Most of what people say about this book concerns their reaction to the science fiction element. I too found it quite affecting, but the greater reason why the novel reached was the mundane half. Specifically, the fact that Ruth is godawful.

Dishonest, cruel, unreasonable, prone to self-serving misrememberings of the past - I think it’s safe to suggest that everyone’s known someone like her. The presence a character like Ruth serves to harm a story for many readers who strongly desire likeable characters, and do not desire to read about infuriating ones. Me, I eagerly want to read about dirtbags who remind me of unpleasant sorts I’ve had to deal with in my real life. I feel validated, a little less lonely knowing that the author, too, is bothered by the kinds of everyday dickishness that get under my skin.

And I don’t think this is a minor part of the book. I think the book gains a huge amount of power by counterposing a vast, horrific society-wide evil against the petty harms inflicted by one girl against her friend and lover, a whole school against one awkward boy. Ruth’s mistreatment forms the big emotional thrust behind much of Kathy’s recollection of her life - yet the background evil of organ farming bubbles in through Ruth’s conflicts with the others. Because Ruth is the only student who seems bothered by being human livestock. Maybe it’s because in being more self-centered, she is more perceptive to injustice being committed against her. Maybe she’s mean as coping mechanism to deal with the horror. Regardless, it’s a uniquely deft way of observing how the lives of individuals interact with big, sociopolitical things.

The book seems pessimistic about these things. But I leave the experience a little happier, a little more able to make sense of the Ruths I meet.",19,14,2025-09-19,PM_BRAIN_WORMS,N/A,0.65
Books that unnerve you so much you can't really start them?,"I can't be the first person to find a book that I just can't even finish the first chapter. Even thinking about the first few pages gives me the hibbie jibbies. A book that I see positively praised and I want to read it, but I just can't get over what happens and what some reviews say happen latter.

I never thought I would encounter a book like that. I thought I was desentized to fiction enough. But recently, it feels like my empathic circuits are in overdrive. (This was happening before my grandma's recent heart attack, but the attack really brought these feelings to the forefront).

For me, that book is Xenogensis/Lilith's Brood by Octavia E. Butler.

First chapter spoilers: >!The whole book starts with a woman waking up who has been abducted, forced under anesthesia, forced to have surgery for who knows what reason, forced to experience a dozen ""awakenings"" with no clothes and sometimes not even a bathroom. Treating her like an animal.!<

My review of The Covenant of Water,"The first part like everyone else has said was BRILLIANT. When the story shifts abroad to Digby I was like wait what? It felt a little disjointed until later on when Digby meets Rune etc.

As an Indian, it felt unlikely that a cook would make samosas and chicken kurma in Madras in the early 20th century. Samosas are primarily a north Indian snack, not a south Indian one especially in that era. Philipose had great potential when he was younger, I got annoyed at his behaviour after marriage, especially >!post Ninan's death!< but then he redeemed himself by becoming more dedicated to his work and being a very loving father to Mariamma.

I liked Elsie a lot initially but then I started disliking her. I wonder how Rune didn't consider that as a young kid who visited St.Bridget's often, she was >!at risk of contracting leprosy especially because kids' immune systems aren't that strong.!< 

Then when she's older and gets married to Philipose, she could've voiced her frustration about his >!opium addiction!< and her other worries at the very least. She gave up totally on her marriage which is kind of understandable, but she didn't even try to vent her angst to anyone in the family like Big Ammachi. Somehow I didn't get the impression that she was really into Digby..even though she says so in her communication with him. It felt more like she thought it was a good idea to be with him. Even when she was with Philipose I just had this deep seated feeling that she didn't truly love him..

Regarding >!The Condition, I honestly felt it was more like a mix of thalassophobia, vertigo and Von Recklinghausen's.!<

I loved most of the characters like Big Ammachi, Big Appachen, Baby Mol, Shamuel, etc. Damodaran was a special highlight, I would always look forward to his appearances.

I ended up buying Mistborn and started reading it.  But when I read it its not in my voice but I'm hearing Sanderson narrate it in my head.  My mind is even recreating his cadence and tone.  Its really off putting and I think I may have a budding parasocial relationship developing with Sanderson.

I'm not an avid reader but I read lots of fantasy books and I always meant to read him but never got around to it.  Now I am and I feel like I got in the wrong way; not through his work but through his opinions.  How do I work through this because it feels really weird—like I'm not alone in my mind.",5,67,2025-09-19,Mattson,N/A,0.54

The Book Thief,"I just finished this up and I quite enjoyed it. So im on lexapro and its really hard for me to cry but at the end i had tears. Not full on sobbing but I was crying.

Books that started strong but ended up losing you?,"What are those books that had such promising beginnings but managed to completely lose you by the end? Squandered potential, bad characters, poor writing, whatever the reason may be?  
Mine would probably be *Under The Dome*\- 1000 pages of build-up and tone-setting, only for the ending to devolve into a strange mad-lib. I still finished it, but I didn't finish it all that happy.

(Un)Reasonably angry at The Secret of Secrets by Dan Brown,"To preface this, a long time ago I was devouring every book of Dan Brown, and I thought I was a fan. This is why I immediately got ""The Secret of Secrets"" as soon as it got out. I thought it would be a book I wouldn't put down, and so many days later I am still struggling through it. Spoiler starting now, up to Chapter 12 of the book.

What I am angry about is the constant exposition of knowledge that we just won't get, even though the current Point of View has that information. 

Things like (big for emphasis)

>! ""the rabbi inscribed THE hebrew word""  which word? Two paragraphs later: ahhh finally !<

>! ""SHE could never know"" WHO? !<

>! ""Solomon had done something unexpected"" WHAT? !<

At least in my memory, The Davinci Code was intriguing without such techniques, but maybe my memory is faulty. Other books I read, for example ""The Tainted Cup"" were catchy without withholding information on purpose.

As reading declines and self-censorship grows, bookshops are shuttering in the city once hailed as the Arab world’s publishing capital.

Bookstores and literary institutions that once flourished in Beirut have shuttered over the past few years. For *New Lines Magazine,* Amelia Dhuga reports on this wider trend in the city’s creative scene. “In the last six years alone,” an editorial director at a publishing house tells Dhuga, “Lebanon has faced a revolution, a financial crisis, the port blast, COVID-19, political instability and a war.” Businesses have been forced to shut down, facing immense financial pressure. Books and authors are being censored. People are exhausted, preoccupied, or simply don’t have the disposable income to invest in literature.

Do you read multiple books from the same author closely together?,"It's not a totally intentional aversion, but I feel no urge to read from the same author back-to-back, even if I love their writing. I go ""Hey! They're great!"" make note of them, and move onto someone else. 

I'm drawn far more often to standalones, and when I do read series, I tend to read the entries pretty far apart. Like months or years, if I finish them at all. Which is rarely a knock on the series' quality. There are just so many books I'd like to get to and, as a reader of average speed, it makes sense to me to use that finite time to sample as much as possible. 

That, and there's avoiding the monotony of a voice becoming *too* familiar, the magic wearing off, and inversely, the fresh joy of returning to a voice you love with the distance of time. 

When you find an author you love, do you immediately go to read more from them? 

Do you plow right through series without stopping, or do you take breaks between volumes? 

How long are those breaks, and when you return, do you reread/skim the previous book(s), rely on synopses, or wing it and hope the author threw in sufficient references? 

Or do you think about none of this at all? Also extremely valid. ",230,215,2025-09-17,Ashestoashesjc,N/A,0.95

"""Phew I'm halfway"" vs ""phew I'm only halfway""","I can't imagine i'm the only one who glances at my bookmark thinking one or the other. As I currently read *The Stand* by Stephen King I'm feeling the latter, fully engrossed in the unabridged story and relieved that I have another 575 pages to look forward to. 

In comparison to my memory of reading Mary Shelly's *The Last Man* which (minor plot spoilers) shares a similar plot premise of an apocalyptic disease killing most of humanity. I greatly enjoyed her story and feel no regret in reading it, I plan to read it again, it was just difficult for me to ""get through"" the book. The writing is extremely descriptive and how I can only describe as eloquently verbose. Mary painted imagery in my mind but I was often interrupted, many times a page, to define words due to her dense sentence structure, vocabulary, and descriptions. 

I'm curious to hear of stories that were difficult for you to read through, but you ENJOYED overall, and stories that were so immersing that you lost some sleep until the last 100 pages where you procrastinated leaving such lovable characters behind. ",116,61,2025-09-17,TheBoraxKid1trblz,N/A,0.85
"Another space adventure series by E.E Doc Smith, ""The Skylark of Space"" first of the Skylark series.","Made another return to the world of E.E. Doc Smith again by reading another book from another of his space operas, the Skylark series! And now I've finished book one of that series ""The Skylark of Space""!

A scientist named Richard Seaton discovers the secret to releasing the ultimate energy, and also the key to space exploration. DuQuesne, a very powerful and unscrupulous man, has attempted to take that secret by any means necessary.

This all ends in space, where both Seaton and DuQuesne and three others wind up being marooned, many light years away from Earth. And with only one in a million chance of returning!

I just love these space opera adventures! this series, like the Lensman series, isn't all that complex or anything like that, just pure simple fun! These stories are primarily going to be focusing on journeys of the Skylark and its inventor, and even including some others too, and also his conflicts with the cold and calculating DuQuesne.

I've just started on another of the Skylark books, but unfortunately it isn't the second book of the series, ""Skylark Three"". Though I try to keep my mind focused when selecting books, especially when it comes to possible series that might come across. But there are still times I end up getting book from a series but it always end up being a second book or other, and it that can mess up the order I'm trying to get them in.",17,8,2025-09-17,i-the-muso-1968,N/A,0.91
Do you have any favorite books that you only learned about because of a member of an older generation?,"Speaking for myself, I had free access to the book collection at my grandparents house when I was young. I tried most of them and liked  C S Forester's Hornblower series about the british navy. I liked the series because it was a compelling set of adventures, but also because it explored the main character's flaws and self doubts, his struggle with necessary mathematical tools for navigation, his social anxiety.  Knowing that I had enjoyed those, led me as an adult to try Patrick O'Brian's excellent and more sophisticated series that starts with Master and Commander. 


More formally, an English professor introduced me to Slaughterhouse Five and the Death of Ivan Illych, both of which I still admire and appreciate. Death of Ivan Illych might be my candidate for best book I've ever read, although I've since then read a few other contenders, notably Remains of the Day.  

Death of Ivan Illych succinctly describes a man's transition from social success to dying invalid and the social cost of that transition for him. It shows the shallowness of his friends and family and how quickly they shift their attention from him to other concerns while he faces death alone. I still believe that people can be better to each other when tragedy strikes, but this book shows that they won't necessarily, in just a few pages. It was a book that changed my impression of what a book could do for a reader. It stretched my concept of what a narrative could show and be.

I couldn't finish the dune series.,I have been reading the dune series for awhile now. I reached the fourth book but I just can't seem to finish it. I already took forever to finish the first three books but this fourth one is a really slow read. The slow pacing is killing me. I've read over half of the book and I feel like nothing actually happened in the past 320 pages.  I don't feel any connection to the characters expect for Duncan and Sonia. I feel like the first book was the last book I actually enjoyed reading in the series and even that is a stretch. The books tend to have the slowest pacing ever and I feel like the characters are more like political pawns than actually being a character I can connect to. I think I am going to take a break from the series and move on to other books.

Thank-you Robert Munsch,"Early today I read about your decision. I've been overwhelmed with so many emotions about it, and I've felt compelled to tell you, or the world, or whoever would listen - how much you mean to me. I've been saddened, but I also feel a certain level of gratitude that you're going to allow us all to say good bye to you. And in this moment, I want to say good bye, in this way, and I invite other to as well. I hope somehow this gets to you. 

I'm typing this on my phone while I sit on the foot of my oldest sons bed. I just finished reading him Moose! I've read it so many times you'd think I'd have it memorized, but I tripped up a few times - he noticed. 

My favorite book to read to my boys has always been Hugs - I get to squeeze them, and tickle them, and slobber all over them. 

My middle loves to read about Mortimer. He loves going to bed first, because we can sing at the top of our lungs. 

Sometimes I think you wrote Thomas' snowsuit about my youngest, but thats not his favorite. His favorite i Mmm Cookies! Because we get to shmack and gwackk them all over his little legs. 

I remember my dad reading your books to my brother and my sister. Our favorite was Purple, Green, and Yellow. We still call some markers the never come off until you're dead and maybe even later markers. It was also the first of your books I bought when my boys were born. 

The second was the paperbag princess, I remember my sister dressing up in a leaf bag as a kid. But what I didn't realize was how empowering that story was until I read it years later - you enabled a generation of princesses to tell the ""not so charming"" they stink. 

You brought so much joy into my bedtimes, and you continue to bring so much joy to bedtime for my sons. I'm sure they'll read you to their kids, and I know there will be little cardboard libraries from you all over this beautiful country.

Struggling to understand a phrase in “The Faerie Queene”,"I am struggling to parse lines 7–8 of stanza 37 of Canto 9 or Book 2 of *The Faerie Queene*. Context here is that Arthur (still a prince, not king yet) is encountering a room full of beautiful maidens. Some represent what the annotators of my editions call the “forward or concupiscible passions,” some the “froward or irascible” ones. Arthur’s eye is caught by one of the latter, who is “right faire and fresh as morning rose, / But somwhat sad, and solemne eke in sight, / As if some pensiue thought constraind her gentle spright.” Then (bolding the part that is giving me trouble):

>In a long purple pall, whose skirt with gold,  
Was fretted all about, she was arayd;  
And in her hand a Poplar branch did hold:  
To whom the prince in courteous maner sayd,  
Gentle Madame, why beene ye thus dismayd,  
And your faire beautie doe with sadnes spill?  
Liues any, that you hath thus ill apayd?  
Or doen you loue, or **doen you lack your will?**  
What euer bee the cause, it sure beseemed you ill.

The annotator explains “ill apayd” as “requited,” and it seems to me like the subject of “hath thus ill apayd” is “any,” with the object being “you.” That is, it seems to me that line 7 means: “Is there anyone living who has thus failed to requite your love for him?” But it is not clear to me if the subject of “doen” in line 8 is still that “any,” or if it is now “you.” And, in either case, it’s not clear to me what line 8 means. If the subject is still “any,” the couplet would seem to be something like: “Is there anyone living who has thus failed to requite your love for him? / Or who has made advances toward \[or had sex with?\] you or”—but here I am unsure what “doen you lack your will” means. If the subject is now “you,” then the lines would seem to mean something like: “Is there anyone living who has thus failed to requite your love for him? / Or have you loved, or”—again, I don’t know what it would mean for a person to “lack her will.”

Thanks in advance. Obviously, the annotations shed no light on this matter.",13,17,2025-09-16,Charles_Sumner,N/A,0.75
SA Cosby’s My Darkest Prayer,"I’ve just finished this one after previously reading Cosby’s Blacktop Wasteland and All the Sinners Bleed, both of which I really enjoyed thanks to the great vibe Cosby lays down with his writing and his main characters, which simultaneously manage to be the coolest most badass dudes around but have actual complexity and inner turmoil that feels real behind all of that.

My Darkest Prayer is Cosby’s first book, and I could definitely tell. It’s way more crass, feeling like 70s exploitation media rather than straight up crime noir, and the characters don’t have a ton of complexity to them, but I ended up loving it in a different way to his other books.

My Darkest Prayer follows Nathan Waymaker. I’ve never read Jack Reacher books, but from what I can gather Nathan is a half-black Rwacher. He’s a brick shithouse of a man that never loses a fight, he’s never wrong, he always does the right, he’s had sex with half the women in town and the other half want to have sex with him, he’s basically a master detective despite his background as a funeral services guy in the marines and small town sheriffs deputy (that ended when he threw someone through a plate glass window) and he’s always got the coolest lines to come back at his rivals with. 

Nathan reads like the self-insert character a 12 year old dreamt up and finally got a chance to write about as an adult, and despite how negative that sounds I loved it. When I first started the book, I was noticing all these cliches it followed and mentally docking it some points, but as I kept reading I just found myself having so much fun taking in this story. 

At the end of the day, the book is closer to a Netflix series I would binge over the weekend than it is to the Godfather, but sometimes I need that and appreciate it.

Finished The Well of Ascension: here’s my thoughts on it,"Warning: I read this in Spanish so apologies if some terms might not be the same as in the English version. I really need to write this down before I forget. This will be long so…

This has been one of the most *acidic* plot twist I’ve ever read in my life.

At first, the book feels a bit slow. Sanderson takes his time with the details, and you get the impression it’s dragging. But one thing I really appreciate is how well he handles reminders from The Final Empire. It had been more than a year and a half since I read book one, and yet I had no problem diving back into the universe. Sure, it can feel heavy at times, but you later realize that every explanation had a purpose.

What blew me away is how Sanderson uses almost the entire book to build up a crisis (not just political, but existential) for a group of people who end up realizing that everything they thought they knew was a lie. In the last 100 pages, he dismantles a fundamental part of the world he had built so far. Suddenly, what’s written isn’t necessarily the truth, and there’s something behind it that can alter history for its own benefit. That idea is insane.

The concept that anything not recorded in steel can’t be trusted, and finally getting the true text of Kwaan’s inscription, gave the book such a massive boost. Everything clicked, and at the same time, nothing was what I thought.

Another huge highlight for me was Vin’s growth. She spends so much of the book frustrated, not fully understanding her own identity. Meeting Zane gives her a glimpse of it, only for her to lose it again by the end. At the same time, she discovers that her powers are far more significant than she ever imagined. I don’t dare say the idea of the Hero of Ages will disappear, because Vin embodies so many of its traits. My hypothesis is that she will ultimately become that Hero, whatever that truly means. I need to see that conclusion. Vin was already a solid character in book one, but her growth in book two is flawless.

The secondary characters also shined much more than in The Final Empire. We got a deeper understanding of their motivations, how they think, and ultimately how Kelsier’s plan, for all his ruthlessness and sharp edges, was rooted in his belief that people are good at heart. Every single character had meaningful growth, and even the deaths felt purposeful.

And then there’s the magic system. The metals, the discovery of duralumin, the way everything expands… it all felt perfect. Yes, this is a dense book. Yes, it drags in places. And yes, sometimes you want to stop and take a break. But short answer: it’s worth it. Every piece of information matters, and I’m certain many of these details will play a much bigger role in book three.

Expanding a bit more on the duralumin… learning that it enhances the power of all the other metals was already wild, but realizing that through duralumin Vin can actually control the kandra and the koloss? That was one of the biggest plot twists in the entire book for me. It basically places her on the same level as the Lord Ruler. It’s not explored in depth here, but I’m convinced this will be a huge foundation for book three and I can’t wait to see how Sanderson develops it.

What exactly meant Terris, the prophecies, the true nature of the Well? What exactly Vin unleashed? We already know history isn’t what we thought. There’s something out there that twisted everything for its own freedom. Is it Alendi? Is it something born out of resentment? Or something else entirely?

Some more thoughts on 'Project Hail Mary' (spoilers),"edit - finished the book. It was a good read. 

After all the hype, I was hoping for 'Amaze! Happy happy happy!' but it didn't quite reach that.

I still think Rocky is easily the best part of the whole book. And I would've liked to see some more about what happened on Earth and Stratt, and more on Erid. 

and since I've read the book now, I saw the movie trailer. 90% of it about Gosling whining and complaining - why does that need to be in the trailer even if is accurate? And of course they spoil everything. Don't think it will be anywhere close to The Martian.

-------------old----------

I'm almost 3/4ths done with the book, I hope its ok to post here and share some thoughts/questions, even though I haven't finished and don't want any spoilers or surprises if they are present. 

I'm up to ch 24 so rest of post will have spoilers till then.

- don't really like the protagonist. He's a very weird mix of character types with no consistency, written to be a movie character almost. he's supposed to be genius level smart, snarky, zero emotional impulse control, he's cried a hundred times so far. its like he's written to be Mark Watney + crying.

- so he has access to literally every book/manual ever written. every ship/boat/aircraft ever built has a flight manual with detailed procdures for every little thing. so why the hell is he always stumbling around trying to figure out things? he's had tons of free time? why didn't he open the 'flight manual' or 'mission briefing' and just read it?

- the book is admired for its science but there are so many inconsistencies. eg in the scene when power goes out he's in the dark asking where the doors are in storage area. yet 2 paragraphs later he's using a flashlight. why the hell wouldn't you grab one first?

- the whole sequence with the ship getting damaged on Adrian. Grace ignores multiple warnings from the computer and dismisses them, out of character. even more unbelievable is Rocky ignoring that, since he's so much smarter

- 5TB storage? in 2021? thats way too low! and laptops? why would he not give Rocky multiple ssd's copied with everything from his computer (all human knowledge, not just wikipedia) and show him the simple program to convert it to sound? such software already exists on there for blind users!

- there are so many wondrous things happening, alien worlds, life forms, planet which is source of all life, yet he barely thinks about any of these.

- Rocky is basically the hero of the book so far. you'd think Grace would spend a tiny bit of time preparing for  health emergencies once he moved in, ask about his life support etc. Instead he almost kills him after Rocky saves his life, because once again he has no clue about anything he doesn't know after his high school days. and he's ungrateful to Rocky, Grace certainly wouldn't have risked his own life like that.

- Grace is not only a selfish coward, he's an asshole, even though the writer tries to make him sympathetic. None of the 'science stuff' he does is really that impressive, he was right, anyone else would've been just as qualified. Wihout Rocky nothing happens. 

- there should be a lot more about how Eridians developed all this tech while lacking vision or science basics. he speculates on this but the answers aren't very satisfying, for a hard scifi book

- as far as writing quality, its very monotone with the same sentence structure. the only well developed character is Stratt, and the only memorable lines are from Rocky.

I just finished The Goldfinch,"  Wow. I couldn’t wait to jump on Reddit and read what other people thought. I admit, I didn’t care for the ending. It was anticlimactic and felt out of place compared to the rest of the book. 

 I am a fast reader so I enjoy a very long detailed book. I could really feel and relate to Theo. The descriptions of after the bomb goes off, the confusion then the realization and fear setting in. When he is with Wenty in his final moments.  I lived  it with him.

 The confusion and denial of where his mom is. This book captures the stages of grief beautifully. He blames himself, and is so convinced it’s true. 

 Then the story 180 of moving to Vegas. At first I was put off because I really enjoyed the NYC setting, but wow it ended up being my favorite part. I’m really surprised at the people who didn’t enjoy it… 
 Boris (sigh) I love him so much. Their friendship is so beautiful. Their brotherhood, I could sense sexual tension throughout all their drunken escapades. I saw some people say, it was just too much of a kid getting stoned in the desert. I was the same age as Theo when I started doing lots of drugs and she captures the feelings so perfectly! 

 
 I was so happy for him when he went back to Hobie, rooting for him and Popper. But sad that Boris didn’t go with him to have an adventure.  He kept the cab drivers words close to heart which enabled him to sell the frauds. So now here he is a grown up, pretty much raised himself, but now also has money. So of course he turns into an addict. That’s the natural trajectory of kids like him. I knew so many others like him. The book kept me hooked. I didn’t see the switch about the painting coming. I spent probably 5-6 hrs on Saturday, reading all afternoon.
I loved being immersed in another world. And yes the ending sucked. It felt unfinished or rushed considering how much detail was spent on everything else. But I saw a post that said it’s all about the journey and not the destination.
And I totally agree. 

Edit- on 9/20 I watched the movie. It really is pretty bad. How most people are describing the book as slow and dragging on (which I didn’t agree with) definitely applies to the movie. If I hadn’t read the book, idk if I would be able to follow the story. I was more curious to see how things were portrayed. And I loved the actor who played young Boris. I thought he was perfectly cast. (I also have never watched Stranger Things so that didn’t give me any sort of bias) ",103,54,2025-09-15,Under_Obligation,N/A,0.91
"I'm late to the party, but Lonesome Dove absolutely rocks.","Wow wow wow, this is an incredibly easy book to give 5/5 stars to. I'll preface this by saying that I've never read many Westerns before (only All the Pretty Horses by Cormac McCarthy), but I have seen some of the more well known movies so I know a lot of the traits and tropes of the genre. That being said, Lonesome Dove transcends all of those things by ditching the romanticized version of the West that people have seen countless times (the rugged gunslingers who always come out on top, the love interests that also resolve in the end, the idyllic and beautiful scenery with magnificent horses, etc) in favor of a brutal and more realistic take. The main gist of the story is that you have two former Texas rangers who, with their cattle company, decide to do a cattle drive from Texas on the border of Mexico all the way to northern Montana, a journey spanning over 3,000 miles. And WOW, what a journey it is. McMurtry pulls no punches here, with the dangers of river crossings, hostile wildlife, lack of water sources, disease, Indian attacks, disastrous weather, and so much more that you wonder how it's possible for anyone to survive. This book is huge as well, but the story had me gripped from beginning to end, and by the end of the story you'll feel like you yourself made the same journey that the characters did. Besides just being a fantastic story, the novel deals with themes like friendship, coming of age, death (a lot of it!), the realities of life at the time, survival, masculinity, fatherhood, love, and so much more. There's quite a bit to chew on here and I will definitely come back to this one in the future. Lonesome Dove is a fantastic novel that you should absolutely check out and I enjoyed it so much that I will definitely read the other three books in this series. This one gets an extremely easy recommendation.",807,155,2025-09-15,laudida,N/A,0.96
Rick Steves: On the Hippie Trail,"Anyone read this one? My wife and I honeymooned across Europe 15 years ago and Rick was a constant companion. I was eager to read this. It's Steves' 1978 journals from his (mostly) land trip from Istanbul to India and Nepal. He dug up the notes during the pandemic. 

The book was pretty short and had some great pictures. Steves has a charming honesty and openness to the world that reminds me of Michael Pollan (do any other authors with this atteibute come to mind for anyone?). He seeks out situations most people would avoid and enjoys some magical moments as a result. I felt almost wistful for a time I never experienced and a trip I would have almost certainly been too chicken to go on.

I’ve just finished reading Long Island by Colm Tóibín,"3 days ago, I found out that Colm Tóibín had written a sequel to Brooklyn. As one of the few who secretly hoped Eilis would end up with Jim but who always believed that no one wanted that, I can’t describe how surreal and exciting this news felt. 

Reading the first chapters felt like reading fanfiction, because here was a second chance for Jim and Eilis. But as I progressed, I realized it wouldn’t be so simple.

Jim was still quiet and gentle, but his indecisiveness and passivity infuriated me. How many times did he hold back from asking the questions he wanted to ask, or demanding answers from Eilis, just because he didn’t want to scare her off? And Eilis became so distant and aloof! How many questions did she leave unanswered? Why couldn’t they just communicate properly?

What I did enjoy, however, was the echo of the first book:

* Mrs. Lacey evolving into a figure reminiscent of Miss Kelly.
* Jim taking Eilis’ place as someone with a secret engagement while pursuing another relationship, keeping both parties in the dark.
* The return to Ireland.
* The wedding.

I even expected Mrs. Lacey to die.

Overall, I wanted to express my delight at having another book, my hope for a third installment, my frustration with the characters and the ending, and my mixed feelings about the story as a whole.

Brooklyn, or at least as I remember it, was largely about Eilis : the experience of leaving her country for a new life in a vast, unfamiliar place; the homesickness; returning home; and the new perspectives and changes living abroad brought her, as well as the temptation to stay in Ireland.

Long Island, by contrast, focused much more on the romantic relationship between the protagonists, and to be honest, it was a mess.",12,3,2025-09-15,herinaus,N/A,0.8
