[In Progress] [600] [fiction] I’m new to this,"So I’ve always wanted to write a book and started doing a creative writing course. This is my first short scene and would like some feedback as to whether my writing is any good. 

Here goes… 

It’s finally time !!! I’ve been waiting for this weekend for so long. A chance to get out of the busy city. We’ve just pulled up outside my parents house and it feels like I’m home. The birds are singing in the trees and a light breeze touches my face. The house is modest, set in acres of rolling fields. 
James unloads the suitcases, I go to grab one but he rubs my swollen bump and insists I don’t help. He’s so caring, he’s going to make the best father. 
We enter the house, my nostrils are hit with the glorious smell of the roast dinner. Everyone’s already in their places. Dads at the head of the table carving the juicy joint of meat. My brothers are bickering over whose bottle of wine is the best one to compliment the meat. My sister is deep into her phone, probably checking her socials for the hundredth time of the day. And my sweet plump mother is fussing over the gravy. 
I go to sit down, and suddenly the glass of juice in my place setting is dripping down me. Bloody baby brain. James swoops in, reaching for his handkerchief instinctively. And that’s when it happens. In slow motion my world is tipped upside down as a condom slaps down onto the table. The room falls silent. My sisters and my husbands eyes lock. Both with the same look of panic in their eyes. My legs give way, I’m on the floor sobbing before anyone can speak. “Get out” I whisper and then add “both of you”. They try to protest. They try to make excuses. But it’s too late the damage is seared into me. A scar that will never fade.

[Complete][124k][adult portal fantasy] The Oathbound Eclipse,"Hello everyone,

I am seeking beta readers for the completed 2nd draft of my debut novel. If you are only interested in reviewing part of the story I can send you a specific batch of chapters to read over or the whole manuscript. The story is set in a modern version of earth that runs parallel with a fantasy world. It takes mostly on earth but encompasses ideas like magic, sword fighting, emperors and invading kingdoms.

**Blurb:**

Roran has spent decades hiding the dark spirit bound to his soul. Despite his reluctance to use its otherworldly magic, he knows there is no one else who can face the oncoming threat. Since Roran was pulled into the fantasy world of Argama, his life has been shaped by magic, war, hostile deities and empires waging eternal conflict.

Roran thought he had found a moment’s peace once he escaped Argama and returned home, but his enemies had only been biding their time. In this false peace, a man appears bearing the powers of the Emperor of Light, a foe Roran thought he had left behind. He challenges Roran to a battle and in the process they create a new rift between their two worlds. Now he must overcome foes who scheme to unite the two worlds while he attempts to seal the tear before it fully stabilizes into a portal. 

If he fails, magic will flood Earth and the Emperor of Light’s forces will march through in conquest. To stop them, Roran must gather his allies and remaster the dark abilities he thought sealed away before the empire brings the full force of their invasion to Earth’s doorstep.

**Content Warning:**

This book does contain swearing and innuendo but no smut. The battles are detailed but nothing overly gory.

**Feedback:**

I am hoping for fresh perspective to see if any parts of the story drag down the pacing or the narrative. I wanted to build up future plot points but I want to make sure all the extra details do not detract from this story. Additionally, I want feedback on the characters and their personalities as well as the magic system in the book.

**Timeline:**

I am very flexible. Just let me know if you think it will take more than a few weeks and I can work with whatever you need.

[Complete] [33k] [Fantasy] The Cinder Patrician,"Hi, transitioning writer here. I am looking for 3 beta-readers for book 1 of The Cinder Patrician: A Noumara Legacy.

**Blurb:** This is a character-driven fantasy novella that blends history, myth, and grief. I wrote it in a more literary style, with a focus on neurodivergence perspective, grief, identity and memory but it still has magic, battles, and a mysterious new world. This is Book 1 of a planned 6 Book saga, and while short, it’s meant as a heartfelt entry point into a larger world.

**Quick Summary:** Three years after losing his wife Claire, compliance officer Lucien Revenant struggles to connect with his thirteen-year-old daughter Jasriel while battling his own ADHD and grief. When supernatural forces attack their New Orleans home, Lucien discovers he's the King of Noumara, a magical refuge created by enslaved peoples who escaped through dimensional tears during the era of Le Code Noir.

Written from a neurodivergent perspective, the novella follows Lucien’s (dx ADHD combined) journey as he navigates a world where magic stems from trauma. In Noumara, Adverse Childhood Experiences become the foundation for magical abilities. Displacement trauma grants portal magic, community loss enables empathic bonds, and survival experiences create adaptive powers. As Lucien learns to harness abilities that respond to his emotional overwhelm and hyperfocus, he must protect both his New Orleans community and his new magical family from Seravax, a corrupted former ally bent on revenge.

With authentic New Orleans/Creole cultural elements and a magic system that transforms trauma into power, The Cinder Patrician combines found family dynamics with innovative fantasy world-building. It's a story about healing, community, and discovering that our deepest wounds can become our greatest strengths.

**Audience:** Adult (or late teens) fantasy readers who also enjoy literary/character-focused stories.

**What I am looking for:**

1. Big picture - clarity, pacing, emotional impact.
2. Confusing and/or disconnected points. Places where you felt drawn in.
3. Favorite (and least) favorite characters, scenes, world-building elements.

I am hoping for a turnaround time of 4-6 weeks, and I am happy to provide thoughtful feedback on your work as well.

[Complete] [74k] [Adult Romance] Until I Met You,"Hello! I have just finished the first draft of my book, and I was wondering if there was anyone on here who would be willing to beta-read the manuscript and give me feedback on it? I am willing to pay if that's what you'd like, but we can talk about prices if need be.

Like the title reads, it is slightly more than 74k words, and it has 41 chapters plus an epilogue and a prologue.

My story does have a few smut scenes in it, but nothing descriptive/graphic. It is about a woman, Adelaide, who was given the power to heal others by a witch. She navigates the world, always healing and never thinking about herself, until she meets the MMC, Matthew. He turns her world upside down, and she is confronted by the horrors surrounding her curse.

It is a romance first and foremost, but I think the sub-genre is fantasy, as it does involve magical healing powers. However, it is not heavy on world-building since it does take place on Earth.

I don't have a specific timeline, but I would like it done before Thanksgiving, if possible.

Here is the prologue and the first three chapters to see if anyone is a match for it: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18tr41XJwGpZVH9VGX0\_KNQZCqX8gWs7b99k8JGuKYok/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18tr41XJwGpZVH9VGX0_KNQZCqX8gWs7b99k8JGuKYok/edit?usp=sharing)

[Complete] [54K] [Adult Horror/Fantasy] Let the Tides Take Him,"Hey everyone!

I've just completed the second draft of my second novel, and I'm looking for a beta reader to get feedback before I edit and send it to a publisher. It's technically a sequel, although my aim is that people who haven't read the first book should be able to read and understand this one. The book is set in the same universe but follows a new set of characters, with only two from the first returning in supporting roles. I have therefore had to include some exposition from the first book. The first book has been published.

*What I’m looking for*

I'd like feedback on any of the following: the plot (does it make sense? Any major plotholes?), the characters (do their actions and motives make sense? Are they interesting?), the dialogue (is it clunky? Unnatural sounding?), and whether the exposition provided is too much or too little. At this stage, I'm not interested in line edits or spelling/grammar corrections. That stuff will be fixed by either me or an editor when I write my next draft. 

*About the book*

The book is about 54k words and is a horror/grounded fantasy novel set in modern-day Cape Town, South Africa. It carries a content warning for discussions of sexual violence and depictions of physical violence. There are some descriptions of graphic violence in earlier chapters, but I'd rate this violence as medium. I have tried to keep the descriptions of sexual violence to a minimum and would be open to minimising it more (although they unfortunately do need to exist given the premise). 

Here's a quick blurb: Neli Langa is a second-year Economics student whose life is disrupted after her boyfriend of nearly a year sexually assaults her, her university refuses to take action, and nearly all her friends side with him over her. When a stranger harasses her in a grocery store, Neli snaps and beats him in an act that draws the attention of Salome, a mysterious café owner.

At Salome’s café, Neli meets three other women, each a survivor of sexual violence, and is drawn into a world where vengeance takes a literal, supernatural form. Neli learns that Salome is a mermaid who is trapped on land and forced to feed on humans every full moon, but only preys on r\*pists. Together, the women enact brutal justice, but Neli soon faces consequences far beyond guilt. After drinking a tea laced with water serpent eggs, Neli becomes bound to Salome in a deadly, parasitic relationship, forcing her to confront the limits of survival, revenge, and justice, culminating in a harrowing battle that challenges her morality, her body, and her capacity to heal.

I'm looking for a turnaround time of 4-6 weeks, and I am open to swaps. 

*Open to swaps under these conditions*:

I'm open to reading fiction in the following genres: horror, magical realism, dystopian sci-fi, and grounded fantasy/sci-fi. I'm open to high fantasy/sci-fi in non-European settings like The Poppy War series by R.F Kuang or Who Fears Death by Nnedi Okorafor, so if yours is like ASOIAF or the Lord of the Rings, I'm afraid it's not for me. 

I am also open to romance (low to medium spice, please. Not a fan of high spice.) I particularly enjoy the following tropes: forbidden love (no incest), friends-to-lovers, rivals-to-lovers, second chance romance, childhood sweethearts, fake relationship (where both parties are in on it), opposites attract, and forced proximity. I’m not interested in bully/victim to lovers. Absolutely NO dark romance in which the protagonist or love interest engages in abuse or sexual violence (I.e books like Fifty Shades of Grey and It Ends With Us) 

I am also open to general and literary fiction and prefer fiction with sociopolitical themes. 

I’d prefer up to 80k words but willing to read up to 100k words. I absolutely cannot commit to work beyond this limit. 

I am open to beta reading writers at any level but would prefer those working on original concepts as opposed to fanfiction (I don’t have any experience with fanfiction unfortunately). As I have publishing experience, I may also be able to provide some advice on that. I am also a Black woman, so if you need a sensitivity reader in that regard or are specifically looking for a WOC beta reader, I may be your girl.

I have also lived in London. Not a native but lived there long enough that if you’re setting your story there and looking for a beta reader to tell you if you nailed it and give you pointers, I may be your girl. 

*Sample work*

Here is a link to sample chapters: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i33A35PM1wbRQV9kdxWvojAKKaFqkTgCNcJC2rmHfG8/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i33A35PM1wbRQV9kdxWvojAKKaFqkTgCNcJC2rmHfG8/edit?tab=t.0)

Please DM if interested in the whole manuscript. If you are interested in a swap, please give me the genre, length, blurb, and turnaround time. Thanks for your time in advance!

 Selene’s life is turned upside down when she discovers she is not only a princess but the heir to Aurelia, one of the six hidden realms. Her bloodline, marked by the essence of the long-lost Celestials, has been kept secret and now her identity makes her a target.

Centuries earlier, two Celestials of opposing powers fell into a forbidden love, defying the laws that held the worlds together. When discovered, she betrayed him, joining the other Celestials, while he turned against all of them, cursing that their essences would one day be reborn. Their descendants would inherit immense power and the weight of their ancient heartbreak and revenge.

Born under an eclipse, Vixen Jakkal, son of Keres, King of the NetherWorld, carries a sun mark and a faded mark, while Selene, born two years later to Aurelia’s rulers, bears moon-shaped and faded marks on her hands. As children, they form a deep bond, mirroring the ancient love, but Keres discovers Selene’s existence and plots to drain both their powers through marriage. When his scheme is uncovered, he is imprisoned, and Selene is sent to Earth with her memories wiped.

Vixen briefly follows her, creating a portal and gifting her a snow globe of Aurelia before returning to rule the NetherWorld. Raised as a normal girl by her aunt and uncle, Selene is unaware of her true heritage until the shadows begin whispering secrets of her past.

Now, with the 100th Jubilee Eclipse approaching, Selene and Vixen must navigate dangerous realms, uncover dark secrets, and confront celestial forces. Together, they face betrayal, passion, and destiny itself, as they struggle to prevent the catastrophic power of their ancestors from repeating and save their worlds.

[Complete][105k][Adult Sci-Fi] The Eternal,"Ora was supposed to be forgotten, just another conquered soul swallowed by the Eternal Empire’s holy crusade across the stars. Instead, she’s pulled from her subjugated planet, renamed Valeria, and married off to the god-emperor’s youngest son like a pet. Suddenly, Valeria is thrust into a courtly world of silks, secrets, and sharpened smiles; where flattery is a blade, loyalty a game, vicious nobles vie for divine favor, and will do anything––*anything*, to get it.

At first, all Valeria wants is to survive. But as she learns to wield her hapless husband’s influence and bend the politics of court in her favor, she discovers a talent for maneuvering, and a taste for power. The more she rises, the more the girl named Ora begins to fade. And as the line between survival and ambition blurs, Valeria must ask herself: is she outsmarting the empire or becoming it?

Combining the ruthless political intrigue of Seth Dickinson’s *The Traitor Baru Cormorant* with the moral attrition of R.F. Kuang’s *The Poppy War*, while echoing the dark legacy of Lady Macbeth, *The Eternal* follows the intimate unraveling of a woman caught between reclaiming her agency and the seduction of the very power oppressing her.

"[in progress] [2,062] [dark romance] Twisted Devotion","Looking for a beta reader or for some criticism. This is a work in progress, it's only a few scenes that are not chronological, and it's my first shot at dark romance. If this isn't allowed, please let me know.

This book is based on the idea of character A being heavily traumatized and conditioned to believe loyalty and devotion are shown a certain way, and he kind of takes the guard dog role. Character B takes the softer, ""handler"" role, and is the only one who can calm A down. A is a bit troubled, and doesn't know boundaries well, while B is patient and kind, and teaches A that boundaries are okay. 

This is a dark romance. There will eventually be nsfw themes, none of which are shown here, nor will they ever. Themes shown here are stalking, child abuse, aggressive behavior, and grooming a child for a position of power. Themes to come are death, kidnapping, and other dark themes. 

Scene 1 (opening)
His love was not gentle.
It was the snarl before the strike, the promise of ruin in the curl of his fists, the unspoken oath that anyone who dared touch her would bleed for it. They called it obsession. He called it loyalty.
And when the haze took him—when his vision narrowed to teeth and rage, when the air itself seemed to quake with the violence in his bones—she was the only one who did not run.
She never feared him.
Even when his knuckles dripped red, even when his eyes burned feral and his breath came in ragged growls, her touch was the leash that never broke. One hand against his chest, one word on her lips, and the beast stilled. For her, always for her, he remembered he was human.

Scene 2 
The man shouldn’t have touched her.
It was nothing more than a careless brush of fingers against her arm as he passed, but A saw it, and his composure shattered. His blood surged hot and merciless. In three strides he had the man against the wall, forearm pressing hard enough against his throat to make bone creak.
“Don’t,” A growled, low and lethal. The word rattled from deep in his chest like an animal warning its prey.
The man gasped, eyes wide, hands scrabbling at the unmovable wall of muscle pinning him. A’s vision tunneled, rage pounding in his ears like war drums. His body demanded violence, demanded blood for the crime of laying a hand on what was his to protect.
“Call off your fucking dog!” The man yelled, fear pulsing through him.
“Enough.”
Her voice cut through him like a blade through fog—steady, unshaken. He didn’t turn. Couldn’t. His knuckles ached, ready to break teeth, ready to spill red across the stone.
Then she touched him. Just the barest press of her palm to his back, warm and grounding.
The fight in him stuttered. The growl in his chest trembled, collapsing into silence. His breath came in harsh pulls as he forced his arm back, releasing the man, who stumbled away coughing and terrified.
A still trembled, violence caged just beneath his skin, but her hand never left him.
“Look at me,” she said softly.
And he did. Every time.
Her gaze was calm, unyielding as a tether, and in that look he found the single truth he trusted more than instinct: she was safe. She was his to protect, not his to frighten. His pulse slowed. His hands dropped, empty now, shaking as though he’d been dragged back from the brink of a cliff.
The man fled without another word. A didn’t watch him go. His eyes stayed on her, and only when she nodded—just the faintest nod—did he breathe again.
“For you,” he whispered, voice raw. “Always for you.”
And he meant it. With every scar, every ounce of rage, every drop of blood still on his hands—his love was hers. Deadly, unbreakable, and hers alone.


Scene 3 (show of his nature)

The room was quiet but for the rhythm of her breathing. She slept curled against the sheets, face softened in the kind of peace she rarely let herself have while awake.
A should have closed his eyes, too. Instead, his gaze caught the faint glow of her phone on the nightstand. One new message.
He hadn’t meant to look. He told himself that as his hand reached, as his thumb brushed the screen awake. But then the words were there, and the excuse burned away like paper in fire.
Still think about you. We had something real. You don’t belong with him.
Her ex. Bold enough to write, foolish enough to think she’d ever read it in front of A.
A’s chest tightened, fury coiling hot and sharp. He looked down at her one last time—still sleeping, still unaware—and pressed his lips against her temple. Gentle. Silent. A promise.
Then he slipped from the room like a shadow.

The door creaked hours later. She stirred, blinking into the dark as A stepped inside. His shirt was torn, his knuckles raw, bruises already darkening along his jaw. The copper scent of blood clung to him like a second skin.
She didn’t ask. Not yet.
Instead, she rose from the bed, wordless, and reached for his hand. He let her take it. She led him to the bathroom, the tiles cold against their bare feet, the light sharp and unflinching.
She wet a cloth and touched it to his split lip. He flinched—not from pain, but from the tenderness of it.
“Sit,” she murmured.
He obeyed, lowering onto the edge of the tub as she worked in silence. Cloth to skin, disinfectant on wounds, bandages wrapped tight with careful hands.
Only when his breathing steadied did she pause, her fingers lingering at his jaw.
“You came back,” she said softly. Not a question—an anchor.
“Always,” he rasped. His eyes found hers, fierce and unrepentant. “For you.”
She didn’t ask what he had done. She didn’t need to. Her hand rested against his cheek, and for the first time that night, the beast in him quieted.



Scene 4 (flashback 1 show of why he believes what he does)

Her hand rested over his heart, light as a promise. She slept without fear, and he lay awake, staring into the dark, as the old memories crept in like smoke.

He was small again, legs dangling from the kitchen chair, the table too high for him. His father’s voice filled the room, thick with anger, heavy with certainty.
“Your life is not your own.”A hand gripped the back of his neck, forcing his head down until his forehead pressed against the wood. “You *breathe* for this family. You ***bleed*** for it. You don’t belong to yourself. Do you understand?”
He remembered the sting of splinters biting into his skin. He remembered trying to nod even though the pressure held him still.
His mother had stood in the doorway, silent, her arms folded tight against her chest. She didn’t protest. Didn’t soothe. Didn’t stop it. Her silence was its own command: ***this is love, this is loyalty. This is how you survive.***
The words burrowed deep, carving out everything he might have been. Devotion wasn’t a choice—it was demanded. To love was to surrender. To be loved was to obey.
And so he learned. He carried his father’s creed in his marrow: ***give everything, keep nothing, and maybe you’ll be worth keeping.***

Now, lying beside her, he touched her cheek. She stirred, softened, leaned into him without hesitation. No demands. No orders. No leash.
And it broke something in him every time.
Because for the first time in his life, he had given himself away—not out of fear, not out of duty—but because he wanted to.
Because she was worth burning for.
Because if his life was not his own, he was glad it was hers.




Scene 5 (flashback 2 show of devotion to family)

---
The kitchen was cold that night, the fire burned low, and his father’s shadow stretched long across the floorboards. A was small—too small to feel the weight of expectation that pressed down on his shoulders, but he bore it anyway, because there was no choice.
“Loyalty is proven,” his father said, voice like iron scraping across stone. He set the knife on the table between them, its blade catching the weak light. “Words are nothing. Devotion is nothing, unless you bleed for it.”
A’s hands shook, but he reached for the knife anyway.
His father’s hand clamped over his wrist, stopping him. “Not you. Not yet.”
Confusion tangled in his chest until his father shoved something else across the table—a rabbit, small and trembling, one A had raised in secret behind the shed. He’d fed it scraps of carrot, kept it warm in his shirt when the nights froze. The only living thing that had ever been his.
“Do it,” his father ordered. “Show me where your loyalty lies. Family first. Always.”
His throat closed, the air burning as he tried to breathe. He looked toward the doorway. His mother stood there again, her arms crossed, her face carved from stone. No mercy in her eyes. Only expectation.
He wanted to beg. To plead. But he had learned already: begging was weakness.
His hands stopped trembling. He picked up the knife.
The rabbit’s heart beat fast beneath his palm. His own heart beat faster. And then—silence.
When it was done, his father nodded once. “Good. You understand. Your life is not yours. Nothing is yours. Everything you are belongs here.”
The words seared into him deeper than the blood on his hands ever could.
---
Present
Lying awake with her head against his chest, he still felt the phantom weight of that night. The knife. The heartbeat. The silence that followed.
She stirred in her sleep, sighing softly, and pressed closer. Her warmth seeped into him, filling cracks no one else had ever touched.
He brushed his lips against her hair. If his life was not his own—if it had to belong to someone—he was glad it was hers.

Scene 6 (flashback 3 show of how he came to know her) 

The city blurred past his windshield, neon reflections rippling across the hood. The paper bag of her favorite food shifted against the seat beside him, releasing the smell of spice and heat. He gripped the wheel tighter. Tonight, she’d smile when she saw what he brought. Tonight, she’d lean into him, trusting without question.
And as always, the drive pulled him back—to the beginning.
The first time he saw her, she wasn’t remarkable to anyone else. Just another face in the noise of the world. But to him, she was gravity. His lungs seized, his pulse stumbled, and the thought struck like a brand: She is mine to protect.
It wasn’t a choice. It was law.
So he learned her. All of her.
He knew he shouldn't. Following her was wrong, but he couldn't stop. 
He knew where she worked—how she lingered at her desk long after others left, absently twirling a pen when she was lost in thought. He knew the name of her boss, the way she flinched when that sharp voice cut across the office.
He knew her mornings inside her apartment. The slight pause between her alarm and when her feet hit the floorboards. The pattern of lights flicking on as she moved from bedroom to kitchen. The exact time she opened her curtains—7:12, always 7:12, as if she needed to see the sun to believe the day had begun.
He knew how she slept. On her side, curled tight, one hand pressed under her cheek. Some nights, she tossed, murmuring words he could never catch. Other nights, she lay still for hours, and he would stand outside her window, breath fogging the glass as though his presence alone could guard her dreams.
He knew her food habits—coffee with two sugars, black tea in the evenings, never milk. Takeout on Thursdays, always from the same place, as if ritual mattered more than taste.
He knew her favorite bench by the river, her notebook pages filled with half-formed thoughts, her lips moving in whispers she thought no one could hear.
There was almost nothing left to wonder about her. And still, he wanted more. Every little thing he already knew, and yet, she remained a mystery. Every piece of her, every detail, until there was no part of her life where he was absent.
Wrong. He knew it was wrong. The word “stalker” burned the back of his throat like poison. But beneath the sickness was a devotion so absolute it hollowed him out. He wasn’t watching her. He was guarding her. He wasn’t taking her privacy. He was keeping her safe.
Until the first time she spoke to him.
Her eyes had caught his, sharp and steady, when he lingered too long in the shadows. She didn’t flinch. Didn’t frown. She only asked, soft as a dare, what time it was.
And in that moment, when her attention brushed him like a hand to the chest, his world bent at the knee.
He would not—could not—leave her side again.
The light ahead turned green. He pressed the gas, knuckles white on the wheel. The food shifted on the seat, warm and waiting.
She had let him step into her orbit once. That was all it had taken. From that night on, his life ceased to belong to himself.
It was hers. Every dark, ruined piece of it.",1,3,2025-09-23,mystofchaos,Short Story,0.67
[Complete] [61k] [Historical Gothic] NEKKEN,"
Hello! I have finished my second book Nekken, which is a folklore inspired fiction novel about Scandinavian water spirit Nekken. Its genre is historical gothic with some elements of romance. I was hoping to get some feedback on my first few chapters as querying has been slow. Don’t be afraid to be harsh or blunt, I need it! I also appreciate any grammar concerns or rules as I am Swedish and English is my second language. 

This story might fit you if you like outsider stories, feminist elements and have a love for horror. 

Blurb:

Nineteen-year-old Helga has always lived on the fringe of her village, Kettla, marked by superstition and her unknown origins after being found in the woods as a newborn. Raised under the strict care of widow Elna Nilsson, she longs for belonging in a world that deems her strange.
When women begin to vanish by the lake, fear grips the community. One night, Helga discovers the truth: the folkloric water spirit Nekken is real, and he is the one stealing their daughters. His music can lure anyone to their deaths, anyone except Helga. Confused, horrified and immune to his magic, she becomes both the villagers’ only hope and Nekken’s newest fixation. Her resistance both horrifies and fascinates him, binding them in a dangerous connection.
As Sweden edges into a new century, Kettla is torn between reason and superstition, prayer and violence. A council rises, a hunt begins, and whispers turn to accusations against Helga herself.
Now she must decide: save the people who cast her aside, or let them drown in the curse they always feared she carried. And as her bond with Nekken deepens, another choice looms: kill him or love him?

Content warnings: 
Violence, mild sexual violence and gore. 

Type of feedback requested:
Blunt, harsh critique.
-  Also, thoughts on main character Helga.
- Voice and tone. (Some have felt that this book feels YA, which is not my intent with this novel. I am a non-native English speaker so I need help to see if this is true!)
- And most importantly; is this story catching you or not? — Do you like it?

Other than that, feel free to say whatever comes to mind when you read it. I love all thoughts and opinions and I’m not sensitive to whatever may come up :)

[Complete] [100k] [Fantasy Noir] [Mystery] The Eternal Rave,"Hello!

I am seeking beta readers for my completed manuscript, The Eternal Rave, a fantasy detective noir novel.



About the Book:

The Eternal Rave follows Nalls Rauld, a city watchman who chases a murderer deep into the bowels of Eralon, the greatest of the kingdom's five cities. His pursuit leads him out of the familiar city and into the chaotic, self-governing territory of the Adventurer's Guild, a place known as The Eternal Rave.

The Rave is a sprawling, city-block-sized entity filled with cutthroats, mercenaries, and adventurers of every species imaginable. It operates under its own ""Guild Law,"" separate from the authority of the king or the City Watch. The entire place thrums to the sound of a constant, mind-altering music that new visitors must acclimate to, a process that can leave them disoriented and sick.

After an altercation at the entrance with the three-headed ogre doorman, Cerberus, Nalls is stripped of his watchman's shield and unofficially promoted to ""Detective"". Trapped inside and tasked with finding his quarry, Nalls must solve a series of cases within the Rave's bizarre and dangerous walls, navigating a world where his captain's rules no longer apply and a single mistake could be fatal.



What I'm Looking For in Feedback:

I am looking for your honest and constructive feedback on several key areas:

Pacing: Does the story flow well? Are there any parts within the individual ""Case Files"" that drag or feel rushed?

Character Development: Is Nalls' transition from a rule-following watchman to a resourceful detective believable? Are his relationships with key characters like Muffy, Hope, Darkeyes, and his captain engaging and clear?

World-Building: Is the world of The Eternal Rave immersive and understandable? Is the concept of the ""Beat"" and its effect on residents clear? Are there any aspects of the guild or its inhabitants that are confusing?

Plot and Mystery: Are the individual cases compelling? Are the clues and resolutions satisfying? I'm especially interested in feedback on the resolutions to cases like ""Sister Sister"" and ""Cages"".

Overall Impression: What were your favorite and least favorite parts? Were there any characters you wanted to see more of? Did the ending of the final case file feel like a satisfying conclusion to this volume?



If you are a fan of urban fantasy, detective noir, and unique secondary-world settings, I would be grateful for your help. 



Feel free to contact me for a copy of the raw manuscript if interested.

[Complete] [66K] [Romance] Magic Chocolate,"I'm looking for Beta Readers for my book, Magic Chocolate. It's a BWWM Romance (Black Woman, White Man), and I'm preferably looking for Black women to beta read, since that's who the book is written for.

I have a list of things I'm looking for feedback on, pertaining mostly to plot, characterization, and other big-picture things.

Warnings: Spicy (Graphic) Sex scenes. Implied bias/racism from antagonist. Bad language.

The book is *mostly* wholesome/cozy, except for the sex scenes and bad language.

I'm looking for a 4-week turnaround, but sooner is better.

If you're interested, please DM me. I'm open to a swap.

**The story**:

Stone’s Creek is a quaint, rural town in northern Wisconsin. There is a secret only locals know: Kirshner’s Chocolates makes a magic-infused chocolate that when eaten, reveals a person’s true love.

Samantha (Sam) Jones is a 22-year-old Black woman driven to keep her deceased parents' small-town diner alive. She hasn’t seen her lifelong best friend, Tim McNeely, since their falling out four years ago — until the day he walks into her diner. But Sam has a secret — she’s loved Tim since as far back as she can remember.

Tim isn’t back from college for her -- he’s returned to win the heart of his high school crush. He eats a Kirshner’s but misreads the signs. He goes out with his crush — and realizes she isn’t the one. The person he missed while gone four years was Sam. He buried his feelings because it’s a love that can’t be. His parents consider her a daughter — after they lost their own daughter years ago. Plus, he returns to NYC in three months to start his new publishing job, and Sam can’t leave the diner.  

They rekindle their friendship. Until one night, a spark flies, they kiss, forcing Sam and Tim to face their feelings for each other. But to follow their love would send both of their lives in a tailspin and uproot everything. 

**Excerpt**: \[I apologize -- there's some weird formatting stuff going on when I copy and pasted it.\]

Supper is the best — it reminds me of old times — and the conversation is even better. By the end of the meal, Tim is even smiling and talking with me.

Mrs. McNeely tries to be discreet — not her forte — when she looks at Mr. McNeely and points with her chin towards the kitchen. They both scoot their chairs out from the table and stand up. ""You two stay and chat, we'll clean the table,"" Mr. McNeely says as they collect the plates and silverware, then walk into the kitchen. Tim looks at me and it becomes awkward again.

 He clears his throat. ""I'm sorry for what I said earlier, and how I’ve been acting tonight. Dad's right. I’ve been acting like an asshole.""

 ""Yeah, you are.""

 He stares at me with a blank look on his face, like I’m not supposed to agree with him. Then the corners of his mouth start to lift upward into a smile.

 ""It's not funny! You were being a jerk,"" I say. I can’t help myself then, and break into my own smile. We both laugh together. *Damn*. I can't remember the last time we laughed together — at anything. It feels good. 

 ""Truth be told — I'm really happy to see you,” he says.

 *Oh my*.

 He looks at me with sorrow in his eyes. “It's just... the way we left things...""

 ""I know,” I reply, feeling regret.

 Mrs. McNeely’s voice came from the kitchen, ""Did Timmy tell you I haven't touched his room since he left?""

 ""So it's like a time capsule?"" I ask her with a raised voice.

 ""Yep.""

 I look at Tim. “Timmy?"" I tease.

 ""Oh god,"" he says in mock embarrassment. Or maybe semi-mock embarrassment.

 ""Why don't you go ahead and show her,"" Mrs. McNeely urges.

 *Was the woman trying to play matchmaker for her son and me*? *No, she can’t be*.

 ""Mom, I doubt she—""

 ""Yes, I do!"" I blurt. *Oops*. *Maybe a little too eager*. 

 ""Cool,"" he says as a smile spreads across his face. I didn’t think he wanted to do it, but now he looks happy. *Did he resist at first because he was afraid I would say no*? *I’m probably reading way too much into all of this*.

 I follow him upstairs to his room. He opens the door and motions me in. 

""Here it is,"" he says. It is spotless, so I know Mrs. McNeely cleaned it — high school Tim did not keep his room like this — but otherwise it looks exactly as it did the last time I was in it, over four years ago. There are music posters that look ancient on the wall. Bands that hardly anyone listens to anymore. I look behind his door, and it is still there. The poster that always gave me hope in high school when I was secretly crushing on him. His favorite singer dressed in a revealing outfit — and she is black. He used to go on about her being his celebrity crush.

""Yeah, she's still there,"" he says.

""Some things never change,"" I say, rolling my eyes and making my voice sound like I think he is ridiculous — all to hide the happiness I feel inside that he didn’t take her poster down.

""You used to wear your hair like her, in an afro-puff,” he says.

""I did,"" I laugh. “I still do— sometimes.”

""I really like what you've done with it now, though, with the twists.”

""Thank you,"" I almost gush, but catch myself.

“— with the gold things,"" he motions.

""These are Loc bands.

""I like 'em. They're cute.""

Not sure if cute is what I am going for, but I’ll take it\*. I look at his bed, all neatly made. I looked at it hundreds of times when we were best friends, and every time I imagined us sitting on the edge of it, making out. The secrets we keep. It never happened. As we got older — in high school — and I matured, the images that ran through my head went from us making out, to him naked and making love to me in that bed. Or sometimes when I was extra horny, I’d think of him pounding me.

On top of his dresser I see a photo of us. We’re both covered in dirt, and both have our matching “Little Adventurer” hiking packs on. “Oh my god, I love this photo,” I say as I pick it up. “We must have been what, eight?”

“I think so. We got in so much trouble. Mom took that picture to shame us.”

“Yeah, we thought life was so tough so we were going to run away and follow the train tracks.” If only we knew how easy things were back then. \*Back before we learned what love is. And heartbreak. And what it’s like to lose a parent\*.

“To be fair,” Tim began,” it was you who was running away. I was just following you.” 

“We were always following each other, weren’t we?” It was more a statement than a question. 

“Inseparable.”

\*I wish we could go back to how we were in those days\*.

""Me, too,"" he says.

\*Shit, did I say that out loud\*?

""Then why don't we?"" I say.

""I would love that more than anything,"" he says.

Now I'm really about to melt into his arms.

""Friends,"" he says as he offers his hand for me to shake.

\*Uggghhh. I want more than that. What's this man trying to do to me\*? ""Friends,” I say as I shake his hand.

His hand lingers, not letting mine go. There is something about his hand — the way it feels. Something is going on. Our eyes lock. He wants to say something. To \*do\* something. I've known him for almost all my life — as far back as I remember. And I can tell he is getting the feels.

He quickly releases my hand and sticks it in his pocket, as he rubs the back of his neck with his other hand. 

We both clear our throats at the same time, causing us to look at each other and laugh. \*Damn, I forget how good that feels — to laugh together like this\*.

""We should probably go downstairs and check on my parents. You know we can't leave those two unsupervised like this.”

""Yeah,"" I say, hoping he doesn’t notice my disappointment. \*Baby steps\*, I remind myself. At least we're talking now. ""Hey, do you want to see a movie or something tomorrow night?"" I ask him.

""Sorry, I can’t. I have a date with Bailey,""

I’ve just finished polishing the first novella in my epic fantasy series, and I’m looking for a few beta readers who enjoy high‑stakes, character‑driven stories with a mix of tactical conflict and emotional depth. It’s a standalone within a larger saga, so you can dive in without prior context.



Blurb:

In the steam‑choked labyrinth of Grindheim’s Dregs, empath‑mechanic Jhace can feel the heartbeat of every machine — and the pain when they fail. When the Authority’s Sanitists unleash a sudden, brutal raid, he’s forced into an uneasy alliance with Tiffani, a former Confluence Agent whose past is as dangerous as the crackdown itself.

Together, they must turn the chaotic veins of the district into a weapon before the next wave arrives. But as sabotage and survival draw them closer, they discover that the fight for the Dregs’ soul will demand more than skill and strategy — it will demand trust, and the courage to face what they’ve both tried to forget.

Content Warnings:

Violence, war themes, mild language, brief intimate scenes (non‑explicit).

I have been sitting on my first book for a long time because of procrastination, but it's high time I put it out there for feedback and critique. I figured I'd try here first!

\-

My story takes place in a solar system slightly different from ours, with different and more habitable planets. It could be described as near-future scifi. It follows three veterans of an interplanetary war. In this world, Humanity and an alien species, the Tynerions, had a conflict that ended with humanity's hard fought and controversial victory, and the aliens getting wiped out.

Two of the main characters are part of the police department on a frontier planet, and their slow desk duty life is uprooted when they get a call from an old battle buddy who works for the space FBI. He is chasing a lead on a case that is bringing him to the frontier. From there, the three embark on a mystery that goes all the way up to the top.

[In progress] [309] [Argumentative/Exemplification] Advertisements and Their Impacts on Culture,"I am writing a paper for my dual enrollment English class and would appreciate any advice on possible improvements.

“Advertisements and Their Impacts on Culture”

Everyone knows that advertisements are a core part of modern-day society; they are everywhere in a person’s day-to-day life. While the article “Seven Reasons Why We’re Irrational Shoppers” by Alain Samson claims that advertising and its impacts on culture are negative, others can argue that advertising and its effects on culture are positive. Advertisements provide revenue for multiple parties, introduce consumers to products and services they may not have been aware of otherwise, and help promote social values and causes.

 

Ad revenue is the income earned by a business for displaying advertisements on its content, websites, or apps. When a company pays to have its advertisement played by a business, the business makes a profit. When a consumer sees the advertisement and chooses to pay for the company’s product or service, the company makes a profit. When consumers do not want to see ads while viewing the business’s content, website, or app, they might pay for ads to be removed, generating more revenue for the business. For example, when Markiplier allows YouTube to play ads during his videos, YouTube’s Partner Program (YPP) pays him $5-15 per 1,000 ad views (or approximately $0.005-0.015 per ad view). YouTube itself also receives a 45% cut of the revenue generated by displaying these advertisements. If one of these ads, for instance, was promoting Nars’ new makeup collection and a consumer decides to purchase from this collection after viewing the ad, Nars Cosmetics makes a profit. If a consumer wishes not to view these ads, they may decide to pay $13.99/month for YouTube Premium to enjoy an ad-free viewing experience, along with other benefits that come with the subscription. This generates more income for the business. This income allows YouTube to remain a service that is freely available to most of the world and allows its creators to put more effort into their content.",1,3,2025-09-22,Strong-Debate-5187,Short Story,0.66

Are you interested in what happens when the lawyers of the world’s biggest pop star and the NFL’s friendliest wrecking ball meet to negotiate their prenuptial agreement?

**What’s it about?**

Avery Quinn is New York’s sharpest prenup lawyer: precise, guarded, and fiercely good at her job. Daniel Reid is her equally competent, infuriatingly charming rival. When the world’s biggest pop star gets engaged to the NFL’s friendliest wrecking ball, Avery and Daniel are thrown into the negotiation of the decade.

Between morality clauses, media leaks, and a viral almost-kiss on a jumbotron, their battle of contracts turns into something else entirely: a sizzling slow burn full of banter, tension, and sparks they can’t quite put into writing.

**Why beta read?**

If you love:

✨ Celebrity & sports romance ✨ Enemies-to-lovers / rivals-to-lovers ✨ Sharp banter and verbal sparring ✨ High-competence, slow-burn chemistry

…then this might be your next read.

**What does beta reading involve?**

For those who aren’t familiar: beta reading means you’ll get an advanced (unpublished) copy of the book and, in return, share honest feedback. Nothing too formal — just your thoughts on pacing, characters, romance, what worked for you, and what didn’t.

[Complete] [193k] [Historical Fiction WWII] Reluctant Contrition,"Looking for a beta reader for my historical fiction manuscript.  My number one issue is that it's VERY long.  I need to figure out how I'm going to trim down the word count to have even a glimmer of hope of a publisher or literary agent showing interest.  I'm an avid reader of many different genres, so I'm happy to swap.  However, what I don't know about writing could probably fill a warehouse.  In my own project, I've simply tried to enjoy the process of telling a story.  I can certainly do my best to offer my personal feedback on *your* story though!

**Pitch**:  Louis Fournier is a young man living in rural France in the time of the Nazi occupation during WWII. After witnessing a brutal public execution, he decides that being passive and obedient, although a much safer option, is not something he can do. Drawn into a web of the clandestine actions of the French Resistance by his more risk-inclined best friend, he must find a way to balance his conscience, faith and humanity with the need to do drastic and distasteful things to the brutal men overseeing the occupation of his home. Unlike Hollywood action movies or comic book superheroes, Louis is not an action star. Like many involved the resistance groups across Europe during that time, he is just an ordinary person forced into extraordinary circumstances. Can he bring himself to do the things that are necessary?

**Tone**:  Tense, suspenseful, psychological, but not without humor.

**Looking for:**  Advice on what can be cut.  There are historical details and explanations, but do they serve to drive the story forward?  Where can I *show* as opposed to *tell*?

**TW:**  Violence, assault

Ariadne Katsaros has always put others first. As the eldest daughter in a loud, loving, and overcrowded home, she’s the one who holds everything together—even if it means putting her own dreams on hold. But when family obligations push her out the nest, Ariadne has to do something she’s never done: move out and start living life on her own terms.

A cheap room in the city is hard to find, until her best friend offers her a solution—live with her boyfriend’s cousin. The catch? That cousin is Nathan Hansley, a brooding tech entrepreneur with a mysterious edge and zero interest in small talk.

Nathan lives by a set of rules, the most important being: don’t let anyone close enough to matter. Ariadne’s always had a way of getting under his skin, and now as roommates, she draws him into a connection he never planned for.

What begins as a temporary arrangement soon blurs into late-night conversations and uncontrollable sparks. But Ariadne is determined to prove she can stand on her own, and Nathan is terrified of what it means to let someone in. Falling for each other might be the one gamble neither of them is ready to lose.

[Complete] [130k] [Post-Apocalyptic Horror/Dark Comedy] Looking for beta readers for conspiracy-horror novel about weaponized sugar and found family in the apocalypse — S.H.U.G.A.R. HIGH: Book 1 of 2,"I'm seeking beta readers for my completed post-apocalyptic horror novel. This is the fourth major revision, and I'm looking for feedback on pacing, character development, and overall readability.

Premise: When synthetic sugar additives turn children into photosensitive predators, a group of survivors discovers the ""infection"" was engineered by the corporation meant to protect them. Following Toshi Takahashi (whose scientist parents died exposing the conspiracy) and Harper Morrison (former trust fund kid learning to survive), they must navigate not just infected children but a bio-mechanical AI van with conflicted loyalties while carrying evidence that could expose the truth.

What I'm looking for:
- Overall story flow and pacing feedback
- Character voice consistency (especially dialogue)
- Which plot elements work/don't work
- General readability issues

Content warnings: Body horror, violence involving children (infected), corporate conspiracy themes, some sexual content, strong language, grief/loss themes.

Timeline: Flexible, but hoping for feedback within 4-6 weeks.

The story blends horror with dark humor and focuses heavily on found family dynamics amid the conspiracy elements. If you're interested in a corporate thriller with a sentient vehicle, I'd love to hear from you.

[Complete] [82k] [Psychological Drama] Forever and a Game,"**Description:**

A character driven, emotionally heavy psychological drama with an underlying theme of adorable childhood wit, and wonder.

**Blurb:**

Sam had a rough childhood, he's got the scars to prove it. When Sam meets Felicity, his bosses child, he knows something is amiss. No one can stand the poor kid, not even her own family. She's hyperactive, energetic, an endless stream of random thoughts and questions. Keenly aware of the signs of a child in distress, Sam strives to be the friend she needs. The unlikely pair bond over Mystic Forest, a fantastical card game. Will Sam's friendship be enough to save Felicity from disaster? Sometimes danger hides in plain sight.

Sam works at Solara Energy where a seemingly simple, yet unsolvable problem  threatens their most import project ever. All eyes are on Sam as he risks everything to uncover a terrifying truth.

Join Sam and Felicity on their unforgettable journey, as two epic tales unwillingly collide. Felicity's charming antics, and witty social faux pas will leave you grinning from ear to ear. Even the hardest readers will shed tears as our unlikely companions confront their woes, both past and present, hand in hand.

**Content Warnings:**

Short, non-graphic descriptions of domestic violence. Nothing too crazy. 

**Preferred Timeline:**

Ideally, a month or less. Looking to publish soon :)

**Feedback Desired:**

What do you like/dislike? What works for you? What doesn't? If something reads too awkwardly, or pulls you out of the story, I want to know. If you found something too confusing, or off-putting, please let me know. Don't over think it and just tell me what you think of the story and the plot.

This story is supposed to instill emotions in the reader. What parts made you feel? And why? If you shed a tear or two at some point, I definitely want to know what part is responsible.

Bonus points:

* Is the blurb catchy? Would it get you to the first page? Why or why not?
* Suggestions on ways to improve the plot/characters/anything.
* How do you feel about the writing. Is it cringe? Cliche? Poorly written?

Note: It's a beta, there will be typos. Feel free to ignore them, or point them out, but don't focus on them.

**Contact Instructions:**

Please reply to this thread if you are interested in reading. I can provide an epub or mobi for e-readers, a pdf, a Libre Office/Word document, or any other format you prefer. Beta copies will be provided by e-mail.

I'm offering complimentary copies of the final e-book (DRM free), and a shout out in my acknowledgements section to all beta readers who provide substantial feedback.

**Short Excerpts:**

>Dread Sheriff Jack never cared for Sam’s reading habit. One time Sam hadn’t immediately come to the dinner table when he was called. He had just wanted to finish the last few pages of his chapter. The Dread Sheriff took the book from him and tore the pages out, scattering them on the floor! Sam wept and pleaded for him to stop. His pleas went unanswered. To make matters worse, the book belonged to the school library. Because Sam couldn’t pay for the lost title, he wasn’t allowed to borrow another book for the rest of the year.

>\---

>To Sam’s surprise, Felicity was already at the breakfast nook when he’d arrived. Alone. A book in one hand, and in the other, a ketchup packet? She sucked the ketchup out, and discarded the empty packet onto the window sill on which she sat. It joined a small pile of empty ketchup, and grape jelly packets, likely acquired from the breakfast bar.

>“Didn’t get dinner again, huh?” Sam asked.

>“Nope,” she replied. Using her teeth to tear open another packet.

>“How long have you been here?”

>“About a half hour. Dad had to drop me off early. I dunno why.”

>Leaving a child unattended in a public place. Another stellar parenting technique from the book of Luiz Morgan. This one would fit nicely in the list of ways to avoid even the slightest of inconveniences brought on by your offspring. How dare they be so inconsiderate, as to exist?

**Critique Swap Availability:**

I'm, open, but I'm giving as much of my free time and focus to my book as I possibly can. Ideally, if you'd like a swap, maybe you won't need a beta reader for a month or two? :) Preferred genres are Fantasy, Romantasy, YA, emotional drama, sci-fi.",3,6,2025-09-21,hernejj,80k,1.0
[Complete] [50k] [Apocalyptic Drama/Horror] The Way The World Ends,"A quick note:

I've given this the genre of apocalyptic drama, as it starts out that way, but the genre sort of... shifts a bit as things go on, and I can't go too much into that without giving spoilers!

**Blurb**: 

Nobody expected the world to end the way that it did.

Everything started getting darker and darker. The dark became real, and thick, and swallowed everything that it touched. It was a physical thing.

Trey had been outside by the car when the darkness became too heavy to walk in. He heaved himself to his cabin, retching on the thickness of it, and shut himself inside. The darkness rose all around, lapping on the wood, but didn't get inside. He turned on all of the lights, and lit a fire, and hid from the dark.

Everything else was gone. Trey just hid.

Until then, about three months after the world ended, when nothing existed anymore in the whole universe except for that one cabin, there came a knock at the door.


**Type of feedback I'm looking for:** 

Anything you'd like to share, but in particular, how does it feel in terms of pacing, characterisation, etc? How would it feel compared to something you might pick up on a shelf in a bookshop?

[Complete] [100k] [Dark Romance/Suspense] The Senators Secret,"
Status: First full draft, looking for reader impressions before professional editing


Jade doesn’t belong in her sister’s world of wealth and politics. Brooke’s guesthouse was meant to be her refuge, but instead it leaves her under the roof of Senator Killian West, her sister’s fiancé.

In public, Senator Killian West is composed. In private, control is the only thing keeping his world from collapsing. Jade’s presence threatens both. She pushes, he holds firm, and the friction between them threatens to split everything open, and the dangerous circles he keeps hidden.

Jade’s search for answers pulls her into a dangerous game of power, secrets, and forbidden desire. And when his world closes around her, she has to decide what she’s willing to lose to survive it.


If you like dark, psychological, character-driven romance with twisted power dynamics, I’d love for you to beta read.




Content Warnings:

Manipulation & psychological control

"[Complete] [73k] [Speculative Adventure] La Cherry – a coming-of-age road trip story with BMX gangs, cartels, and aliens in Tijuana","Hi everyone,

I’m looking for beta readers for my novel **La Cherry** (73k words, complete). It’s the sequel to *Orange Crush*, but it works as a standalone. No prior reading required.

**Blurb:**  
Set in the mid-1990s, Liam thought a weekend run to Tijuana would mean cheap repairs and a quick escape. Instead, he and Clare stumble into a city of cartels, border deals, and something stranger: red-skinned agents, black liquid rituals, and a woman called La Cherry who fights with kids on BMX bikes at her side.

What begins as a rescue mission for a missing girl spirals into a battle at the edge of worlds - half revolution, half celestial war. Somewhere between the gunfire and the glowing orbs in the sky, Liam has to decide what he owes his friends, what he fears, and what kind of person he’s going to be when the night finally breaks.

*La Cherry* is a border-town fever dream: a story of loyalty, chaos, and coming of age in the middle of someone else’s war.

**What I’m looking for:**

* Overall impressions: did it keep your attention?
* Clarity: were you ever confused about the story or characters?
* Tone: does the mix of gritty realism + surreal weirdness work?
* Characters: did you connect with Liam, Clare, and La Cherry?

**What I can offer in return:**  
I’m happy to swap beta reads, especially for speculative, adventure, or coming-of-age manuscripts.

If you’re up for a wild border-town ride with BMX kids and cosmic chaos, I’d love your feedback!

//Trigger Warning : Suicide//

# An Ode To The Sea

I was a child when I drowned.

I’d fought against ocean currents,

A competition in who could swim the furthest from shore.

I won, but this time I had to start fighting the ocean currents trying to drag me further.

Too far for them to hear my screams.

Eventually I caved. What can a child do against the ancient ocean?

What could anyone have done?

Someone smarter and older would have known where to stop.

Someone stronger could have stayed until help came.

Someone louder could have made themself heard.

Not me.

The waves washed over me, savoring my dread.

It knew I knew what was coming.

I anticipated my death.

It anticipated my death.

Water filled my lungs and I let it.

My last breath stolen from me and I let it.

Water pressure crushed me and *I let it*.

One day I learned to breathe again. And I was on dry land.

I stayed away from water from then on, avoided it like the plague.

But every night, I play the ocean sounds.

And I remember.

The water in my lungs that tasted like the freedom of air.

The last breath that felt like the gasp of pleasure.

The water pressure that cradled me, keeping me safe in its embrace.

I wonder whether it was my fault. Everyone tells me it wasn’t but…

Someone’s to blame.

And you can’t blame the sea. It was following nature’s course.

And who else is there to blame but me?

Someone smarter and older would have known where to stop.

Someone stronger could have stayed until help came.

Someone louder could have made themself heard.

Not me.

I remember when I drowned in the sea. And when I *let* the sea drown me.",2,2,2025-09-20,Inner-Expression-637,Novelette,1.0

[In Progress] [94k] [Thriller] Dark Recipe – A Knox Ramsey Thriller,"Hello r/BetaReaders, I’m a debut author with 30 years' experience in industrial automation and ag-tech, seeking up to 10 beta readers for my techno-thriller, \*Dark Recipe – A Knox Ramsey Thriller\*. I’d appreciate your feedback on the opening draft.

The story follows Knox Ramsey, a Midwestern engineer whose AI-driven Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) platform, FarmLake, optimizes indoor farming of leafy greens and cannabis. When a Chinese cyber-unit hijacks it, they trigger a poisoning at Detroit’s Movement Festival that spreads to crops like lettuce and tomatoes, endangering national food security. Knox, facing financial strain and a recent divorce, teams with his son Tate, a cannabis grower, and federal agents to stop an algorithmic sabotage before it kills thousands. The narrative blends Shanghai’s precise hacks, Knox’s personal stakes, and the U.S. response, echoing Tom Clancy’s technical edge and Michael Crichton’s science tension, with series potential.

I’d value your input on the opening’s hook, the technical details’ pacing and clarity, character authenticity, and whether it pulls you in. The excerpt—Prologue and Chapter 1, about 5,000 words—is a work in progress. 

Please comment if interested, and I’ll provide a Google Drive link for a view-only copy. I’m aiming for 4-6 weeks of feedback, though I’m flexible, and I’m open to swapping critiques with thriller writers.

Brief Synopsis

At twelve, Eve gave up her throne to accept a destiny that would exile her from her world and everyone she loved. For seven years she trained in forgotten realms, surviving alone, forged into the weapon who must inherit the Watcher’s mantle—the power that guards all existence.

Now nineteen, Eve’s first mission takes her to Earth, where the devouring darkness spreads faster than ever. But her return reopens wounds left behind: siblings who would kill for the throne she abandoned, bonds of loyalty twisted into resentment, and temptations that test the limits of her control. Her Guardian reveals the truth of her prophecy—the Watcher’s role is not simply to defend existence, but to shape it, with power that could corrupt even the purest heart.

To claim the mantle means wielding creation itself, but once the Watcher steps down, there will be no one to guard the worlds against the darkness until she decides. In a game of power, desire, and betrayal, Eve must determine whether she is protector, destroyer, or something far more dangerous.

*Trolland* is aimed at boys 16+ and anyone interested in Scandinavian folklore, Norse mythology, and survival stories. Think The Hobbit (Tolkien), The Hunger Games (Suzanne Collins), Lord of the Flies (Golding), or The Sea of Trolls (Nancy Farmer).

**Blurb:**

What begins as an exciting trip quickly turns into a struggle between life and death.

When Harald, Filip, Leo, Alf, and Arthur spend their summer in Western Norway, Arthur shows them a mysterious valley no one has stepped into since the Viking Age. Few of them take him seriously, but the mysteries deepen when Harald discovers a cave with old runes.

*In memory of Hordason the brave, from Horda County, are these runes engraved:*

*On a ship he sailed with eight men.*  
*Through a ring of fog, they reached their end.*  
*They had arrived at the giants’ land,*  
*but only one returned home with a bloody hand.*

*The dangers there were too great.*  
*Our god Tor had stirred up their hate.*  
*We do not want to see our own forgotten in a foreign grave.*  
*That is why this script is hidden for you, the brave.*

Driven by his hunger for adventure, Arthur persuades them to row out to sea. After a day, they reach an uncharted island and quickly discover they are not alone.

Just when they need each other the most, their friendship falls apart. Forced onto separate paths, they meet new friends and must cooperate in order to survive. Homesickness grows, hunger torments them, and in their darkest moments they wonder if they will ever see their loved ones again.

of he/him for her would be strikethrough-ed) come get ready

Mother grunted, not thinking it would be heard. She could tell
they were having that disgusting chicken again by the musky
animal scent drifting through the vent. Sophie wanted to delay
having to choke it own and other things for as long as she
could... Also che wasn't done on the computer yet! Sophie
reglued her eyes to the screen and began reading the article she
had just clicked on.

""Clearshore Inlet's treasure-filled dungeon islands: beginner-
friendly, or hardened veteran breaker? Our reporters say: a
mix of both and everything in between! We all know where


dungeons come from. A group of high-ranking priestesses
spend weeks enchanting and pouring mana into a cave or ruins,
then the magic bends the earth to create rooms and hallways.
Monsters and treasure manifest from the deep earth magic wells
to populate it, creating the dungeons we all love to explore!
That's how it's normally done, but not in Clearshore Inlet! A
century ago, a priestess from the High Priestess's inner circle
went insane and created these crazy dungeons in a day! Off
the track for a second: If an inner circle lady from 100 years
ago could create something so complex in such a state, imagine
what a modern one could do with her right r mind?1

Anyway: our Exploration Station team stayed a week here,
spending each day as immersed in the dungeons as we could.
We saw all kinds of monsters and, of course, collected lots of
treasure! From simple elemental slimes to monster crabs, and
even a few lesser drakes! The highlight of the trip was, apart
from the treasure and rare alchemy ingredients, an owl bear on
the first level of one of the dungeons! This just goes to show how
chaotic, unpredictable, and; in our opinion; FUN Clearshore
Inlet can be! Exploration Station dot com gives these dungeons
a 10/10 on the fun scale, but a 4/10 on the practical scale. While
you're there, check out The Peony Tearoom and tell the lady
there that Big Chet sent you!""

Sophie let out a soft giggle both at how cute Chet sounded and
thinking about the fun adventures his team must have. ""I wish
I could go out exploring like that, but that would cost money
I simply don't have.. Also; Clearshore Inlet, where the heck
is that? It's English, so it must be on the American coast, but
it's probably in Maine or something.... So might as well be on

Proloque:

Venus to me. And dungeon crawling? Hardly for me..."" Sophie
quietly thought,self-deprecating... She looked down at her
body, which hadn't felt quite right since she started puberty. ""I
know I can never do magic because I was born a boy... Even if
I somehow could, I went to that stupid Selenian private school.
That backward waste of bricks wouldn't teach magic anyway!
I'd have to start learning preschool-level at 21 and that would be
just silly..."" Sophie sadly puzzled and felt her body. ""I'm short
and thin all over. Even when I had my tomboy phase and started
lifting weights,I could barely gain any muscle or lifting power.
Even If I joined an adventuring party, I probably couldn't use a
word effectively... Not without magic. Sophie felt the tears
start welling in her hazel eyes as she let it stew ""Everything in
my life would be so much better if I was just born a girl...I
wanna be a girl and use magic so bad... Somebody online told
me that makes me transsexual, but what can I do about it here?
In hell..."" Sophie sat sobbing for a minute; lamenting her life,
gender dysphoria, and situation before she heard the familiar
dreaded footsteps followed by a knock. ""£€BEa, we're sitting
down for supper!"" Mother cried like nails on a chalkboard.

""Coming!"" Sophie yelled back, trying her best to sound like
nothing was wrong; as cheerful as ever, the perfect child. Sophie
quickly X'ed off the page she was on, tried her best to wipe her
tears. She puts on her male formal clothes: a white linen button-
up shirt, a blue sports coat, and black dress pants; she finally
opens her door. The bright hallway lights feel like a white-hot
star going supernova directly in front of Sophie's eyeballs! They
never failed to make her recoil since she started keeping her
room dark. After she rubs her eyes to adjust, she notices how
extravagant and lavish the house she grew up in really is. The

floor is a checkerboard of white and black marble, polished
by the servants to a mirror finish. The walls are beautifully
carved solid mahogany panels on the bottom, and an elegant
white floral wallpaper on the top. The ceiling as well were
scooped and adorned with white, carved wood supports"" and
chandeliers. Truly, no expense was spared; and that's what
mother told the designer. Sophie couldn't help but momentarily
daydream about a life she might have had if she had been born
in the right body. ""'Oh, to be a princess in this castlel! To wear
poofy ball gowns to the many galas my father took me to, to
have makeup artists and hairdressers on staff to help me feel
beautiful whenever I needed or even just wanted to."" Sophie
softly smiled, but quickly gathered her mind from the sparkling
pink river, before she could completely melt into it. ""Back to
reality, I guess."" Sophie sighs to herself and hardens her heart
as she walks down the stairs to play her role in the dollhouse.

""Finally, there you are! What took you so long, sen?"" exclaimed
Father with a mix of annoyance and genuine concern. That
disgusting word... It crunched on Sophie's soul, making her
internally flinch. ""I... um... just wanted to finish reading
an online article, Father,"" Sophie explained as she took her
seat. ""Ah? What kind of article?"" Father questioned. Sophie
simply cannot tell the truth here. She would like to avoid
another tongue-lashing for as long as she could. Adventuring
in disgusting, pagan dungeons with those devil-worshiping
sorceresses? Hardly the kind of life for a sweet, Selenian
boy. ""It was about how...umm..."" Sophie tried too hard and
took too long to think of a fake article. She nearly jumped
when her father interrupted her thinking. ""If you can't even
remember the subject of an article you read 3 minutes ago,

Praloque:

that speaks volumes about the writer's skills. Don't vou think?
Bah! It doesn't matter, I was just trying to make conversation,
and the food is here as well."" As usual, Father bulldozed the
conversation; not caring a single whip about the other person.
That skill serves him wellin his corporate job but does very little
to help his relationship with his daughter. Mother scurried like
a roach from the kitchen and joined us at the table, just in time
for the maid to sit her plate right in front of her. Was Mother
helping in the kitchen? Not!

Sophie ate in relative silence, or at least tried to eat...Ick...
What even is that? Trying her best to ignore & dissociate as
her family began their regularly scheduled parade of hateful
rhetoric. ""Those disgusting sorceresses think it's ok to use
magic! Don't they know what that means? Hell is hot,
People!"" ""Those heathens, romping around in dungeons! Who
knows what they're doing! And who knows what's even down
there?! I read today that the monsters are created from the
dreams/nightmares that happen above them. Eghh!"" ""I can't
believe they...""

Oh my goodness, enough... Sophie's mind quivered as she
tried her best to tune them out. Her chest tightened as she
searched for a happy place to daydream about, anywhere to
escape from this stuffy dining table... Sophie daydreamed for
a sweet moment, about... Clearshore Inlet! Ahh... The mere
thought of it makes Sophie feel as if she could exhale after
holding her breath for four hours. Wouldn't it be so nice to be
in a party of adventurers there? We could go into the dungeons,
get our packs full of rare materials, & then after we could have

so much fun around a campfire! There's marshmallows & the
laughter of close friends sharing stories. Maybe... Even though
I can't be a sorceress, I could wear a pretty dress like one...?
Maybe a green one that's really flowy, with lots of lace and
ruffles and ribbons! Oh, rapture, that would feel SO beauti-
""Don't you think so too, son?""

""Huh?"" Sophie snapped back to reality & responded half-
heartedly,""Oh, yeah. They sure are disgusting."" Mother rolled
her eyes ""You weren't even listening! Ugh! Honestly, I don't
even know why I bother, I'm so tired of you always spacing
out and never listening to us!"" Mother looked at Father with
a knowing look & then back at Sophie. ""Son...We really feel
like that computer and those fantasy novels are rotting your
brain... We're going to have to take them away. This has made
it all the more evident why that's necessary.""

""W-what?! You can't do that!"" Sophie protests, her mouth agape
at the sheer audacity! ""I'm 22 now, & I bought that computer
with my own money! You can't tell me what to do with it!"" ""Well
maybe if you started acting like the proper man Selen created
you to be, you could do what you wanted."" Her father tapped the
table to accentuate his points. ""You delude yourself with these
fantasies & that stops you from living logically! Those books
you read & the people on t the internet only serve to deepen
those delusions! You need to stop thinking... whatever it is you
think you're doing... and put that economics degree that I paid
for, to use!"" Sophie could feel her eyes flooding by the second,
she bit her lips to desperately try & stop it. ""Y-you know I grew
out of that, Father. I wanted to please you, b-but I just hated
it so much..."" Sophie averted her gaze to her lap & pursed her

hands, as if to physically hold back the geyser of emotions. Her
s
cheeks are burning with emotion. ""Can we stop talking about
this please? H-hey! What's for dessert?"" Sophie tried her best
to choke up a smile. ""Dammit, sen! You are too old for this!""
Sophie's spine nearly jumped out of her skin! Father cursing
at me? For all his faults, that's a rarity. The dam holding Sophie's
emotions finally burst. 'Tears flowed down her face like a river,
when Sophie finally realized; why is she doing this? These
people love the perfect persona of what they want me to be,
hat Ipurposefully put out; but not ME.

Just then, it was if sponges had grown in her tear ducts. And
Sophie adopted a stoney facade, just enough to get through
supper. She was done with these people. ""Okay, you're right.
I'll try my best to grow up. All those things are silly. Thoses
dungeon wanderers are bound for hell anyway. I'll box those
silly books up tomorrow morning, heck I might even burn
them."" Rach word was carefully cherry-nicked from her narente'
jar of favorites. Sophie's mother & father were seemingly struck
by their child's sudden subordination, but glad none-the-less
""W-we're happy you see it our way, son""

Sophie wanted so badly to stand up & scream obscenities at
the both of them. Tell them EXACTLY how she felt, but that
would only make what she needed to do harder & make a lot
of unnecessary tears. ""Yeah, I just realized it was all so silly & I
should just make the best of what I have."" Garbage. Her father
hummed in affirmation ""Good for you! My pal at work has
a brother that works in the bank in town! He's been asking
about you since you graduated, he'll give you a job for sure!""
""Oh great!"" Whatever, I'll be long gone by next week anyway...

Maybe I'll get to embarrass Father one last time, if I let him go
through with it.

The rest of supper went by uneventfully, with Sophie choking
down this pathetic excuse for food while secretly focusing on
vhat needed to be done. ""Whew! I'm stuffed! Excuse me, I'm
going back to my room."" ""Well alright, son. Me & your father
are so proud of you for your revelation tonight! Even if it did
feel sudden."" ""Yes, I'll call my friend right now. He'll be happy
you've decided to join him! You'll have a solid-wood desk job
before the week is out! Nameplate and everything."" Sophie's
'dear-ol-dad"" held out his arms for a hug & smiled bigger than
she had seen in years. ""Son, you won't regret this. This could set
rou up for lifel!"" Even though she consciously knew she had no
intention of staying, she subconsciously shivered at the thought
of being trapped behind an office desk, doing accounting for
the next 50 years! If her mind was not already made up, that
would have definitely shocked the truth into her. ""Yep! Can't
wait!"" she chirped, silently praying to a goddess she didn't yet
believe in.

Sophie speed walked up to her room as fast as she could without
anybody asking what was wrong. She softly closed & locked
her door. Not like anybody cared enough to visit with her or
check, just as an abundance of caution. She sure wasn't doing
it for anybody, Sophie essentially had this whole hall to herselft
""Finally."" She steeled her heart & dived for her biggest suitcases,
bags, tubs, totes, boxes, anything that could hold anything else!
As she was pulling things out of her closet to pack into, Sophie
caught a glimpse of her painted young handprints. It was then
that reality started to dawn on her ultimately fantastical plan.

o

Peloque:

The tears started to well in her eyes once more as she realized
what she was doing... She's grown up in this house, her entire
childhood has been in this room. I'm just going to leave, without
even saying anything?

""Maybe this is all silly.."" Sophie gave a defeated sigh and looked
at her adventure fantasy book collection... ""Pfft. How silly
& childish of me... I never should have dreamed of anything
beyond what's here... in my b-bubble..."" Sophie's voice breaks
& her tears fall like rain. ""Maybe I really should throw all these
away... Act like I actually meant what I said..."" Tearfully, Sophie
did start to grab a book or two to put away, the first book she
grabbed just happened to be her favorite: ""The Sorceress of the
Silver Blade & Friends"". Sophie's face softened in nostalgia. She
smiled as happy memories flowed of herself as a tween reading
it by flashlight under the covers. She had to read it in secret
at first, nobody was aware she had it! If they knew she had
book about SORCERESSES, of all things, it would mean a
behind with red hickory marks and the end of her privileges
for a while! She was ultimately discovered, of course. Mother
found it, where Sophie had squirreled it away, while cleaning
her room & confronted her with it as soon as Sophie came home
from school. It took a lot of weasel-ish half truths & strategic
falsehoods, but Mother somehow relented into letting her keep
it & even allowing her to buy more. That's how she ended up
with 2 entire shelves full of heroic adventure books! ""Oh my
goodness, it's been so long! This book was amazing! I'm so
happy they had it at the book fair.""

Sophie opened the book to a random part to read, just to
remember for a few minutes. A few minutes turned into an

hour. That hour turned into two. Sophie laughed with her old
friends, like she hadn't missed a beat with them. Lyra would do
something silly to get under Terra's skin & it would always work
on her! Cassius would flirt with Lyra & she would go along with
it at first, just to end up blowing up his face with a fireball! Stitch
& Terra had such good chemistry, working together repairing
the group's stuff; Sophie was sad they didn't end up together
Then came the part, THE part, Sophie's favorite part of the
book! If this was a movie, Sophie could recite it without help
AND act it out perfectly! Sophie wondered if she would like
playing Lyra or The Golden King more... Who am I kidding?
Obviously I would do Lyra every time

Lyra has finally been captured by the Golden King! He has
tried so many times to capture her & ultimately he has his
ruby red gumdrop! He had ordered the most lavish of cages b
built for his Queen-apparent when he first found her. Made of
solid gold, with two gorgeous rooms each as big as the whole
orphanage she grew up in. The rooms were furnished with the
finest furniture money could buy (or his enslaved artisans could
make); solid mahogany frames, pure gold details and trim, and
ultra-plush; soft cushioning on every possible sitting surface
that felt like a dream made manifest! The closet was filled to
the brim with more clothes than Lyra had owned in her whole
life! Upon each hanger was a lavish, luxurious dress made of
silk so soft you want to mummify yourself in it. The Golden
King bent down so his massive head was at eye-level with the
cage; to look down and admire Lyra, his new possession, What
do you think, my Queen?"" The word ""Queen"" rolled off his
tongue, as if it was the most lavish; most exquisite sweet in the
world. ""Is it not perfect? I created everything in this cage

to

Proloque:

nake sure you could have the best li-..."" He was interrupted by
a punch right into his huge eyeball! ""T'm not your queen, you
oversized kettle!""

The Golden King's armor clattered against the stone floor as he
clamoured to his feet. His face a grimace; contorted in a mix of
sick betrayal, anger, & anguish. ""B-but why nooot?!"" His hands
now pleading with Lyra, his puppy-dog eyes the size of Terra's
kite shield. ""I can give you everything you could ever want or
need. Every possible desire & whim would be answered at the
toll of your handbell! Your entire life is mapped out ahead of
time, and each day is filled with wanton earthly pleasure. All
you have to do is give up. Let me behold your beauty each day,
for as long as you live."" Lyra stared at him, fists on her hips,
her mouth aghast in disgust! ""You think I want any of that?!
None of that sounds fun! Where are my friends? Where is the
adventure? Where is the freedom?! Sure it sounds 'nice' and
easy, but that's not the life that I, LYRA HERZBOMBE, want!""
Her voice rose in volume, from determined to an impassioned
yell! Right as her speech reached the climax, her heart shone
with the light of a thousand stars! She thought her mana reserve
was as dry as the Aha Makhav Desert, but there was just enough
Ieft for one more... FLAME-""

""-HAWK FORMI!!!"" Sophie shot up like a rocket at mach

came an almost equally loud vell from elsewhere in the house...
Sophie's face suddenly felt as hot as Lyra's attacks. She covered
her face & fell back down into her bed, giggling and smiling. T
haven't done that in at least 5 years, it felt good to feel that...
That feeling... The feeling of utter freedom, breaking out of

a cage with full determination."" Tonight, the scene took on
a completely new meaning for Sophie. She was able to truly
see from Lyra's eyes, because she has been Lyra in the Golden
King's cage for years. The Golden King was her parents, always
wanting her to be something she wasn't. The house was the cage,
comfort in exchange for her self-actualization, her identity, her
dreams... Every day, it was as if Lyra had instead said ""Ok,
Golden King, I don't care about anything... Whatever...""

New tears welled in Sophie's eyes again, but these weren't
tears of pure sadness or despair, no! These are the tears of her
emotional cup running over with pure determination, bravery,
FREEDOM! ""FlameHawk, freaking, Form"" Sophie said to
herself again, almost in a whisper, as she started packing her
books into a huge tote bag.

It took her quite a few trips to get everything, but Sophie indeed
got everything she truly cared about in the car: the tote packed
smack-full of her books, A suitcase packed with all the feminine
clothes she loved; along with some she just tolerated; and a few
of her... ""boy"" clothes that could be read as gender neutral, a
mountaineering backpack with lots of survival gear; from her...
ugh... doomsday prepping phase; because she truly didn't know
what to expect, and a tub of all Sophie's various curios/knick-n
acks/tchotchkes/whimsical trinkets whatever you want to call
them. She kept some of them because they were expensive, and
some just because they were cute even though it was ultimately
trash; but they were all HER'S and not a single person could
contest it.

Sophie's butt was finally in the driver's seat, just like it had been

Proloque:

so many times; but this time was different. She knew that when
she left,her feet would never meet the soft, welcoming, but
ultimately well-worn carpet of her childhood home ever again.
The carpet that she had walked countless times, that had known
every pair of shoes she had worn, the carpet that had probably
seen her first steps. Sophie sniffled. She knows it's silly to get
motional about stuff like this, but it's still sad all the same. Is it
really ok to leave like this? In the middle of the night, at... what
time is it..?> 3:32 AM? Sophie paused, thinking intently on
what she was truly doing...""I have to see it one final time..""
Sophie whispered to herself, full of determination, having not
diminished even one lumen since her burst.

As gently as a sentient mouse opening the door to a cheese
cellar; Sophie inched the heavy, solid wood door open. She had
done this a few times already tonight without a tissue of issue,
but she wondered how many more chances she had? Sophie had
almost a decade of experience, learning where the stairs and
floor creaked and it really paid off here. She moved soundlessly
through the house, like a kunoichi going in for the kill! She
was finally there & there wasn't a single, minute inkling that
anybody- ""Wow, you really did mean it, didn't you?""

""""M-Mother? What are you doing here?"" Sophie's voice, as well
as her hands, were shaking in pure fear and dread. She clicked
thelight on to see her mother standing there in her worn muslin
nightgown, holding the stack of baskets that used to hold her
girly trinkets. It had to be THAT nightgown, the one they had
snuggled in millions of times, when mother was still soft and
the center of her world. When she was still ""Mommy"", now she's
just ""mother""; the difference was everything. She has proven in

Daughters of the Peony Tearoom

millions of different little ways that the woman who raised her
is gone, shriveled up into a hateful knot of her former self.

""Imean good grief, son. I know you think you're some kind of
sneaky-sneak, but you were making enough noise to wake the
dead! You know how lite I sleep, and it's a miracle your father is
still asleep. Even though he sleeps like a log. You were banging
and crinkling and folding like they were doing construction!""
Each word hammered a nail into Sophie's head and heart. How
could she forget how lite mother sleeps? ""So I got up to see
possibly what you were doing. I heard you 'reading that inane
devil book again, and I was scared it was going to be like all the
other times you said you would turn around, but end up not
doing anything.""

Mother paused to wipe imaginary tears in her eyes. ""It warmed
my heart right up when I saw you carrying those bags to the car,
to donate. I'm not sure why you want to donate them, thevT1
just end up corrupting more youth, but I'm happy to have that
garbage finally out of the house! You know how much I hated
that garbage you kept in these baskets, didn't you? I had to
look myself, I had hope; but I wasn't getting too happy until
I confirmed it. You got rid of all your pervert clothes too for
me! I'm so proud of you, sen. You're finally growing up into
the young man Selen created you to be!""

Sophie truly, honestly didn't know what to say. She had been
emotionally gut-punched so many times in such a short amount
of time, and so much more in the last 5 years, that she was just
simply numb to it. Even though she didn't know this would be
the last time she spoke to her daughter, all she can be is hateful

14

Proloque:

to her. Right up to the bitter end. Yeah, for sure Mother.""
Sophie smiled a hollow smile, one that didn't reach her eyes;
Mother wouldn't notice.

Sophie drank in her room, one final time. She tried her best to
enjoy it, even though Mother was there and she didn't know
what her daughter was doing. ""T'm so happy I get to be in here,
without being sick, now that all your weird stuff is gone!"" That
was it. ""You know, mother? I'm so excited, I don't think I
could sleep anyway. Why don't you go back to bed, and Ill
take that stuff to drop-off right now?"" Mother looked back, her
face showing her twisted disappointment ""Aww, right now? I
wanted to go with you, to see it be gone for real!"" ""Hehe.. Well,
just be satisfied that it's gone. Good night."" ""Love you, son.""
""Love you too, mommy."" ""Aww! You haven't called me that in a
long time! ""I know.""

[In progress] [12k] [Speculative] I Need Help with Plot?,"Okay, so I have the start of a novel, but I keep writing myself into dead-ends. I have the premise and a beginning, but I don't know what to do with it, so I was wondering if folks wanted to brainstorm with me?

I have a bunch of threads and ideas, but nothing is working for me....

Here is the summary of what I have:

""When you die, you have three options: take a chance on an unknown afterlife, be reincarnated and live another life on earth, or try your hand at being some sort of Higher Being. The condition for accessing any of these choices is that first you must complete a task to effect some change in the world of the living. 

Mira is choosing a fourth option: sitting in Limbo for the foreseeable future. Of all the possible assignments—everything from starting a war to getting a cute couple together—Mira was assigned to kill her little brother. Apparently the universe likes a bit of irony. Mira does her best to make a life in Limbo work for her. She volunteers as a Limbo greeter. She joins a book group. Mira can’t fathom an eternity in Limbo, but she won’t kill her brother—at least not until he is an old man.

Abby’s arrival in Limbo puts a kink in Mira’s timeline. Abby is assigned the exact same task as Mira, and she has no problem killing some guy she has never met. Abby’s willingness to complete her task is fueled when she discovers that her target is the drug dealer who sold her best friend a fatal dose of meth.""

**\[Preferred Timeline\]** \- Two to six weeks. Critique swaps would be difficult for me at the moment as I am dealing with some care issues with my father. I finished the novel in May, just in time for a bunch of family tragedies to kick off. If leniant on timeline, happy to give it a go.

**\[Trigger Warning\]** \- My story includes violent scenes and implied torture. No sex or cursing.

**\[Story Blurb\]**  
Rowan is in her freshman year with a dream of becoming a doctor, hoping to help prevent anyone from suffering the tragedy she experienced with her mother's death during childbirth.

While working in the university's history museum, she comes into contact with a splinter from the Round Table, which opens up her world to a secret war that has raged for 1,500 years, involving humans with super abilities, ghosts, and sorcerers. And now she finds herself with her own ghost companion and an ability she could have never imagined.

Over the course of the next week, she finds herself on the run from people who want her dead and discovers friendships she could have never imagined.

I currently have it available as .doc or .pdf. I've never tried other formats, but I'm more than willing to try.

**\[Sample\]**

I had never really cared for history. Sure, I had taken the required classes throughout high school, but it’s safe to say the amount I retained is non-existent.

If I had only known what was coming, I probably would have paid much more attention. Who could have ever guessed that not only my future but the entire future of the world would depend on history?

Knowing my feelings on the topic, imagine my horror when I found the only job available on campus was in the history department’s museum. I suppose it’s a good enough excuse to nap most nights.

My roommate, Stephanie, had also put off looking for work as she was too busy socializing to give it much thought. Now, not only was I stuck with her endless positivity at home, but it also followed me to work.

Between being stuck looking at dusty relics all shift, and hearing Stephanie drone on about the latest gossip in her infuriating life, I longed to be bored back home on the nights Dad was out on patrol.

To make things worse, though, Stephanie also seemed to care about what was happening in the museum.

“Can you believe it? We have some cool stuff here already, but this? This could be the coolest thing in any museum.”

“Uh-huh.”

[In Progress] [17k] [Mob/Crime] Backslide,"Am I wrong for not introducing my MC until the ""5th"" Chapter? 

So this is the rough draft of the ""pre-chapters"" of my book. They go by roman numerals (i, ii, iii, iv, and v)—so it would be like i, ii, iii, iv, v, then Chapter 1, 2, so on and so forth. Now, my MC, Katarina (Kat) is not introduced until Chapter v. Is it wrong? Should I just label them straight out as Chapters 1, 2, up to 5? Basically, these 5 pre-chapters are a big prologue. I thought, I have established in my blurb that the character is a female, so that might not be a problem at all, but I dunno.

Also, do my dialogues tell me that I shouldn't watch too much Netflix? :3

[Complete] [80K] [Upmarket Historical] FINDING ECHINACEA,"Hello! Thank you for taking the time to read through this! I hope that if you like what you read you will DM me for the chance to beta read. This book has been through many substantial edits and I am hopefully nearing the end. If you are really good with sentence level edits, I need you!

**FINDING ECHINACEA:**

**Genre:** Upmarket, Historical, Women’s Fiction, Literary Romance

**Themes:** the bonds of siblings within broken families, the struggles of poverty and class, the choice between duty and opportunity, and the ways one can find strength in other people.

**Pitch:**

Eleven years ago FLORENCE HILL, a stubborn inn maid averse to change, made a promise to her little sister she now struggles to keep. The drink took her father and her mother still crumbles under the weight of a broken heart. After a co-worker at the inn falls ill and a quarantine is set in place to stop the spread of typhus, uncertainty shakes the foundation of all Florence thought was sturdy in her life. Although a husband was never part of her plan, Florence’s mother matches her with a well-to-do newspaper editor and she finds that his wealth and status may be the solution to all their burdens. 

As an orphaned child in the city, DR. JENKINS incited a terrible accident in a desperate, futile attempt to save his brother. Now, he has been enlisted in a volunteer medical group and is unwillingly dragged to the countryside. His title of doctor can't offset his lack of proper training and he knows he must get back home as quickly as possible or risk making the same, ill-informed mistake he made before.

When his path crosses with Florence, he becomes inextricably tied to her as his escape back home and finds himself forgetting the reason he wanted to leave in the first place. Instead, he concentrates on making certain Florence doesn’t make as grave a mistake as he did. 

In Florence’s eyes, Dr. Jenkins is the opposite of a savior and she is determined not to let the irksome newcomer disrupt her fast-approaching marriage and the careful balancing act of a cure she has assembled. Yet the more he pushes her to be someone she never thought she could be, she finds herself enraptured by him. As they cautiously circle each other, they reveal the unsettling truth that their pasts have not defined them as strictly as they thought and they may not recognize who they have become.

**Tone:** Reflective, lyrical, tactile, historically essence-ed 

**Looking for:** I can't really read in return at the moment (I just had a baby!) but would be open to it in the near ish future. I am hoping to find just one, or two people who can read through at a quick pace and look of glaring sentence level problems. I am on draft 9 so the plot and structure are all set. I just need help with all the nitty gritty writing stuff.

**TW/CW:** death, drinking, mild medical descriptions, blood, cheating, domestic abuse

[Complete] [100k] [Horror/Apocalyptic] The Shadows Above,"Hello everybody. I am an author who has been writing books for about seven years now, but this time, I have something I am confident in sharing and publishing in the future. I am looking for feedback from any beta-readers interested in reading this story. I have been writing it for three years now, and I am confident it is one of my better books. 

  
The book is centered around a 14-year-old girl living in a zombie apocalypse while being immune to the virus, which you learn early on in chapter one. She must fight her way through life with a group of people she gathers along the way, knowing that zombies aren't the only monsters out there preying on her downfall. 

  
**On the back of the book, you would find this description:**

Ophelia's story isn't about living or finding a cure. It's about hunger. The hatred of hunger, the violence of hunger, and the predatory hunger both man and beast face. It will show you how mankind is no better than the vicious creatures that lurk in the streets. Nothing could prepare her for the years to come, and all she can do is ask herself. Who are the real monsters here, and how do we get rid of them all? 



I am willing to take all and any criticisms. Since this is a long book, I would say **six to eight weeks** would be a good period of time to read it at your own pace if you decide to do so. Don't want to read the entire thing? Up to **four chapters** will be perfectly fine as well. I know people are busy with life. 

**There is a content warning list** before any chapter starts, so please make sure to read through it carefully to make sure you know what you're reading, and if you don't want to read it at all, that is also perfectly fine. I would never force you to. 

I hope any beta-readers enjoy the story, and I am excited to know what you think from a non-biased side of things.

[In Progress] [55k] [Slice of Life Supernatural Horror Romance] Vicarious,"""I'm not murderous."" The ghost crossed her arms and pouted at the implied accusation.

Blurb: A ghost takes particular interest in a librarian, setting off a chain of intimately unsettling encounters. Slowly, his formerly peaceful day to day life begins to unravel and melt away into pools of both physical and psychological distress. You'll find yourself falling in love with an eccentric cast of characters, weaving humor and familiarity into the dark dreamlike haunting of a fairly typical world. 

Tw: alcohol, gore, gore involving animals, sexual violence, sexual themes in general

This story contains characters with diverse backgrounds and identities, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone conservative.

I think it'll resonate best with neurodivergent people who have experienced some form of trauma: especially chronic illness or an abusive relationship. It's about the messiness of it all, and how life keeps on moving despite it. 

I'm looking for any feedback people are willing to give me. It'll serve as good motivation to keep writing. I'd like to know if it's a story worth telling.

[Complete] [129k] [Crime Fiction] Dead Man Running,"“What did you do? Did you do something bad?”

Bruce Grisholm is struggling. He’s struggling with his daughter’s illness, her distaste for his checkered past, and a propensity for violence that he shuts behind closed doors. Above all, he struggles to be someone she’s proud of. Once he cracks those forbidden doors open to let off some steam, he can’t stop himself… but he might be able to stop a new killer. The only way out might be through his past. At the end, he hopes, he won’t be the same man.

Hey, all. I finished the first draft of this novel last week (I started in 2019 but re-started for the umpteenth and final time in May 2024), and I’m going through and taking a bunch of notes for story, pacing, and typos. The book is broke up into 5 sections, and comprises 29 chapters. Each section has an introductory “chapter” that cuts back to a time before most of the main plot, so you could call it 34 chapters, but those just count differently in my head. 

I had a lot of fun exploring Bruce, my main character and exploring the question of “what is a good man?” throughout my time with him. He’s looking for meaning through religion, a career, and reconnecting with a daughter he’d neglected for so long, but nothing feels as good to him as turning back to his old life, and letting his base instincts loose. The battle is as much external as it is internal. Is this all he’s capable of being, is this what he’s meant to be, or is there another answer?
—-

Excerpt (from Chapter 2):

“What did you tell the doctors?”

“I said ‘No,’ for now,” Bruce said. “I wanted to talk to you first. If I signed you up for it and pushed you into it, if I made you feel like you had to keep fighting for me, and it took you - I couldn’t live with myself.”

Robin nodded but furled her lip. She fought back the anger that threatened to explode. Her eyes traced a distinct path between his arthritis gloves, his beanie, then directly into his eyes. “I’m staying here, whether you want to be here or not. Are you going somewhere?”

“No, I just went for a walk last night.”

“And you’re wearing a beanie indoors, because…”

Bruce stepped back into his chair and hunched forward, with his hands drooped over his knees. He reached up, grasped the dark beanie, and pulled it off. Robin gasped when she saw the wound on his head.

“What did you do?” Robin asked with a start. “Did you do something bad?”

“Looks like we’re matching, huh?” Bruce slipped the arthritis gloves off, and the cold air bit into his scuffed knuckles. Robin took a deep breath through her nose.

“What happened? Did you,” Robin leaned closer and whispered. “Did you kill someone?”

“No. At least, I don’t think I did. It’d take a real bitch to die from a broken nose.”

“Dad!”

“Sorry,” Bruce gesture the Sign of the Cross over his upper body as a joke. “I am working on it, really. Should I have stayed in and listened to our sermons?”

Robin didn’t speak. She just have him the look.

“He pointed a gun at me, attacked me on my walk. I was having a bad night. Honest.”

“And the stitches? The haircut? I can’t believe - this is so you, isn’t it?”

“On the up and up. I called the police. Luke, you remember Luke, right? Luke picked me up and drove me here. Ambulance came for the other guy.”

“Nobody’s pressing charges?”

“No,” Bruce stressed. “I’m not.”

Robin made another face at that. It was obvious to Bruce that she didn’t believe him, or at least that she didn’t believe his presentation of the facts. Either way, he slipped on his arthritis gloves, picked his beanie back up, and put it on. The idea from last night, the single tear covering her expression when Caitlyn the nurse called him a good man. She didn’t believe it. With how he felt right now, he didn’t think he was a good man either. But he wanted to be, or at least be as good a man as he knew how.

“I’m sorry. Let’s fight this -” Bruce looked for a tamer word than the curse he almost said and settled for a weak one. “- fight this thing, okay? And I want to fight for you too, okay? But I don’t know how to do that.”

[Complete] [97k] [Romantasy] The Last Light of Vespera,"I stepped away from writing this story, and started something else, but as most of you well know, I can't stop thinking about my people, and now,  I am back at it.

I am hoping to find a few beta readers interested in reading; **The Last Light of Vespera**.

**Summary:**

At its heart is Lira, a fierce and resourceful young woman whose bond with the land runs deeper than she realizes. Hidden within her bloodline lies a dormant power, forged through generations of secrets meant to shield her from dangerous truths. Her intimate knowledge of the forest and indomitable spirit might be their only salvation against the Dark Root and the Clouded—a relentless force of corruption threatening to consume the realm of Vespera. Lira’s journey is one of self-discovery, bravery, and the weight of choices that could alter the fate of an entire world.

Bannon Hallowbrook, a steadfast leader, stands beside her. Despite his unwavering sense of duty, he grapples with self-doubt, striving to reconcile his perceived shortcomings with the faith others place in him. As he leads a group of survivors toward the city of Caedrian, he finds an unlikely ally in Lira, whose strengths and insights challenge his perceptions and help guide their fragile group through perilous trials.

Together, Lira and Bannon must navigate a world poised on the brink of collapse, where fables bleed into reality, trust is a fragile lifeline, and hidden legacies hold the key to survival. *The Last Light of Vespera* offers a gripping exploration of leadership, the unbreakable ties to ancestry and nature, and the courage to rise against impossible odds.

Daniel didn't recognize this guy or his outfit.  Maybe he was a new mercenary.  They get a lot of mercenaries like Alex passing through.

A shattered glass pulled Daniel's attention away from the unknown man.  He grabbed a broom and  dust pan from where it had been propped up against the wall. When he turned around it was clear where the accident had happened by the group of people now crowded around where he assumed the broken glass was.

[In progress] [70k] [Psychological Horror] Nøkken,"This is a psychological horror novel set in the Rondane mountains in Norway, following Markus, a painter who plans to end his life on the tenth anniversary of his partner Ulrik’s drowning. Convinced he caused Ulrik’s death, Markus watched the police dismiss his case for lack of evidence, and Markus has been in self-imposed exile as punishment since. As the tenth anniversary approaches, his latest paintings, meant as tributes to Ulrik, begin changing on their own, showing Ulrik’s body and other strange figures in water.

As Markus investigates local folklore and missing-person cases clustered around the places his paintings alter, he comes to suspect Nøkken, the water spirit said to lure the grieving with violin music, is haunting him and somehow bound to Ulrik. Each discovery drags him deeper into a cycle of deaths that eerily mirror his own despair.  
The book is as much about grief, guilt, and survival as it is about folklore and horror, and it is character-driven.

For now, I'm only looking for feedback on the first five chapters. Specifically, I'm looking for feedback to see if this character driven way of writing works as I want it to, and if the pacing is good enough to keep readers engaged. Any other notes are of course also welcome :)

If you like what you read, I'm for sure open for further beta reading once the book is done. The second draft is currently finished, and undergoing line edits. The first five chapters for beta reading are done with line edits (famous last words right there...).

For now, I'm only looking for swaps for similar lengths and genres/themes :)

[Complete] [95K] [Fantasy] VIRGO,"Virgo, a constellation living in the mythical Heavens with all her fellow zodiacs, is the living embodiment of light and joy. At least, that’s what everyone thinks she is.

In truth, Virgo secretly harbors the power to destroy or kill anything. She rejects this ability, going to great lengths to contain and control it. But there are others in the Heavens who would do anything to obtain this power for themselves. And when the power-hungry Scorpio discovers that she has it, he will stop at nothing to gain it from her. 

*****

Excerpt: 

“You’re late.” His voice came like an echo in a cave. 

Virgo looked around but could not find its source. “I am not,” she said. “I’m actually early. To not showing up at all.” 

She expected some witty retort, but was only met with silence. Virgo gripped the fabric of her skirt. Something about this situation felt… off. Her internal compass pointed out, out, but she encouraged Mono forward. 

“Where are you?” 

“I am through the gates,” his voice replied.

“What gates?” she asked. But before Scorpio could say, Monoceros snorted and stopped. In front of them were long black iron bars that narrowed into points. Virgo carefully lowered herself into the mud, pushed the gate aside and entered. 

The moment she did, Virgo knew this had all been a mistake. She should have stayed home or run to Capricorn or done anything besides walk into his trap. Here, the fog hung in mere whispers above the water. Insects trilled and frogs croaked in cacophonous concert. Fireflies sparked and will o’ the wisps flickered on the moss-scented air. Beneath a willow tree sat a small table with a white linen cloth and two metal chairs. On it were bread and red wine. 

Scorpio stood beside this table, dressed in a fitted, high-collared cassock. Its black silk was studded with chips of onyx and fiery black opal. At his back was a cape of crow feathers and beadwork that spiraled like vines. 

Virgo tried to get back through the gate but found that it was locked. 

Scorpio pulled out a chair. “Have a seat.”

The Maiden slowly turned back around. “Scorpio, this is—”

“Our meeting,” he said, and he nodded to the chair. 

Virgo didn’t budge. “I know what a meeting looks like. Meetings don’t have white linen tablecloths.” 

“Semantic as usual,” he said, and he sat. “Now if you don’t mind, we have a tight agenda and I fear we are already three items behind.”

  Darkness.
  It devoured everything.   
  The sliver of moon above was barely bright enough to cast light through the dense canopy of trees that surrounded her.   
  The effort to stay quiet was becoming increasingly difficult the longer Stephanie’s mind played tricks on her. Each sound, every shadow, was the monster she was running from.   
  What had started as a typical night with friends had turned into every woman’s worst nightmare - being hunted by a stranger.
  At first, there were sneaking glances at the bar, then easy banter and flirting, and finally the decision to throw caution to the wind and leave with the person for some privacy. 
   Now she was running for her life in the stifling air of the woods she'd fled into. 
   A twig snapped to the right, and Stephanie held her breath. Crouched against a large tree, she closed her eyes and tried to slow her breathing.   
  “You can’t hide forever,” a voice called out, the elation sending shivers down her spine. “I will catch you.”   
  She clasped a hand over her mouth to stifle her sob as she shook her head and prayed for rescue.   
  She knew, God, she knew, that no one was coming.   
  Her friends thought she’d gone home with the stranger, cheering her on in their drunkenness.
  Why did she ever think it was a good idea to go home with someone she didn't know?
   “Boo.” The gleeful whisper came right by her ear, and Stephanie screamed.
  Hands seized her, hoisting her from her crouch and slammed her back into the tree. She fought with everything in her to break free, but they were faster and stronger.
   “That’s cute,” they chuckled, catching her wrist and pinning it above her head, breath hot against her ear. “But I win.”   
  Searing pain exploded in her stomach, stealing the breath from her lungs. The knife slid in with terrifying ease. A scream got caught in her throat as the blade yanked free and was driven in again. She felt the warmth begin to pour down her stomach, the air becoming heavy with the metallic tang of blood.   
  The void closed in as her legs buckled, and she collapsed.   
  Crying, scrambling in the dirt.
   Trying to cling to life.
   They watched from a few feet away as Stephanie dragged herself across the forest floor, her movements becoming sluggish.
   Blood soaked her shirt, her hands, and the ground beneath her. The dirt churned in her hands as she clawed her way through the forest’s leaves. 
  She continued to put one hand in front of the other, but her body faltered, no longer under her command.   
  She pictured her friends, her family, her life.   
  It wouldn’t take long now for the wounds inflicted to rob her of the life she had left.   
  Stephanie stopped fighting, realizing her fate. Her beloved cat back home would wonder where she was. She would never fulfill the dreams she had for her future: meeting someone, starting a family, and growing old.   
  Their face blurred as her vision swam.
   “Why?” she whispered.
   They approached, their shoes crunching on the dry leaves, and smiled.
   They leaned in. “Why not?”
   They caressed her face with chilling gentleness.   
  The last thing she saw was their eyes, bright with twisted excitement.

"[Complete][141,000][Historical Fiction] The First Man to Die After the Guns Fall Silent","Two boyhood best friends, Sidney, an Englishman, and Kurt, a German, find their profound bond shattered by the outbreak of World War I. Thrown onto opposing sides of the Western Front, they are forced to reconcile their romantic ideals of glory with the brutal reality of trench warfare. As loyalties to love, family, and country collide, they must confront the ultimate question: can their brotherhood survive a war that demands they become each other’s enemy?

Told through an interwoven timeline which features the two best friends from childhood into adulthood and the war that separates them all the way till the final shot rings out across the Western Front. This intimate tale tells the story of Sidney Jones and Kurt Richter, brought together at the age of ten, they are instantly best friends despite the language barrier. 

Sidney is an idealist and athletic prodigy. He views being a solider as the greatest honour and the greatest adventure, until he is faced with charging the German lines at Loos, not knowing whether his friend will receive the point of the bayonet. 

Kurt is an romantic and a poet. He and Sidney grow close through their shared bond of military history, but when Kurt can't reconcile his love for Sidney's sister, he risks fracturing their friendship. When the archduke is assassinated and Germany falls under the cloud of war, Kurt sees it as his duty to fight for the fatherland, but unbeknownst to him, Great Britain will join the war as his foe. Cursed behind the trigger of a machine-gun, will he know if he felled his brother, or will the bodies that pile before him remain faceless?

Akin to books like Birdsong by Sebastian Faulks, All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr - The First Man to Die After the Guns Fall Silent is a story about Brotherhood vs Nationalism, the loss of innocence and the reality of war. It is a love story and a story of betrayal. Can they survive the front? Can they survive their trauma?

**Feedback wanted:** Emotional weight, character feedback and general engagement of the plot. Also would like to know of voice consistency and just anything that the reader does/doesn't like. Especially things that seem contrived, or wrong and especially if about the voice being set 100 years ago.  

**Availability to swap:** I have a tendency to accept everyone as a critique partner, but I don't have the time to commit to many (work, father to a toddler, and writing n'all). I would love to have a critique partner as I genuinely enjoy it, but will accept anyone who just wants to beta read.

When he accidentally weaves an orb of Joy-light, Kael discovers he’s a rare Fluxweaver, capable of shaping emotions into radiant power. Whisked to the Resonance, a hidden sanctuary, he enters a secret world of Fluxweavers and trains alongside the fiercely optimistic Mira and his ambitious rival, Toren. As Kael hones his abilities, a spiral-flame locket left by his mother unlocks memories tied to the legendary First Echoes, the ancient source of all Fluxweaving. But his growing power draws the attention of the Silencers, a ruthless group led by the enigmatic Sylas, who seek to eradicate Fluxweavers. With Haven’s End and the Resonance at risk, Kael must unravel the locket’s secrets before his power—or the Silencers—consumes everything he loves.

[Complete] [126k] [Literary/Upmarket Psychological Fiction] Deserve,"***A quiet teen in a broken home clings to a first love that becomes her escape***—***and her undoing.***

Hey everyone! I'm looking for a few beta readers and/or sensitivity readers. **You'll be a great fit if you enjoy:** character-driven novels, psychological suspense, slow-burn tension, toxic/obsessive first love, coming-of-age stories, nonlinear/flashback structures, ethically complicated characters, and mental health/recovery.

**Summary**

Ama is a quiet high-school junior who is drawn to Mateo, a charismatic senior who offers her an alluring escape from her fractured family—and from her own mind. But innocent first love quickly spirals into something more dangerous, revealing what she’s been hiding from herself. In the aftermath of her choices, Ama must piece together who she is.

*Deserve* is a portrait of a young woman coming of age in suburban Utah, under the weight of control, addiction, and secrecy. It takes an unflinching look at the days that define us, the people who shape us, and the imperfect nature of healing.

**Content Warnings**

This book tackles heavy themes through a trauma-aware and trauma-sensitive lens. This is told through the perspective of survivorship, not melodrama. Especially sensitive matters are handled gracefully and are implied, not directly shown.

* Abuse (Coercive control, psychological abuse, physical abuse, neglect)
* Addiction, drugs, and alcohol
* Racism (particularly against individuals of Hispanic or Latino descent)
* Self-harm
* Sexual abuse (off-page, referenced, not depicted)

Full content notes and additional context available via DM/email if helpful.

**Feedback Wanted**

I'd love to know thoughts on how the story flows, characters, plot, if there's enough of a hook early on, etc. If there's anywhere you get confused or your eyes glaze over, I want to hear about it.

Latine readers would be wonderful if possible. Sensitivity readers for mental health, racism, addiction, etc. would also be great if possible.

**Timeline**

Preferably within two weeks, but this is negotiable. I appreciate the time.

[Complete][87000][New Age/Non-fiction]Possession: A True Story,"My book is about my theories on human telepathy and also tells the story of strange occurences in my life that formed my belief system. I try to write telepathy so that it is relatable to anyone, and offer stories that show how you can sense it in your day to day interactions. My story also tells the tale of my telepathic awakening in my early 30s after denying my personal beliefs in it through my 20s, and then the tragic tale of me becoming too involved with the exciting experience, becoming possessed, then almost killing myself, and being left disabled. The book is supposed to be informative about my beliefs in telepathy, but should also read like somewhat of a thriller of demonic possession.

  
Themes covered in my book include: Telepathy, Possession, Spiritual Awakening, Secret Societies, Conspiracies, Aliens.

  
Why am I posting it here:

  
I am posting this for beta reader because I am currently going through the process of trying to get it edited,  but most editors want a fair bit of money to even assess the manuscript. I would like to get a better idea for what kind of editing I need, so I don't overspend with an editor.

[In Progress] [102K] [High Fantasy - Pathfinder/Orcs/Found Family/Slow-Paced/Intermittent High Action] Papa Fourarms and Little Star: Prologue - The Death of the Briar,"Hello everyone!  This is my first time seeking critique and beta reading for my manuscript, and I am currently looking to have available readers give me some feedback.  I would eventually like to start posting the first finished novel in chapters on a site such as Royal Road, and have started work on the second novel in the series while I button up and get feedback on the first.  I am more than happy to do a manuscript swap on a one-to-one basis, or however the exchange ratio needs to work as I am aware that my current manuscript is a bit up there in word count.  If you are looking for a high-fantasy adventure set in the Pathfinder universe, look no further.

PS: I hope you like Orcs.

**Blurb:**

In this prologue book introducing the reader to the world of Papa Fourarms and Little Star set within the Pathfinder/Starfinder universe, the peace of the Dragon's Hand Delta is shattered when a nomadic Orcish clan stumbles upon the legendary hero of The Shardstorm, Athalbhar, Briar of the Delta, having been assassinated in his secluded forest home.  As the clan picks through the massacre trying to determine its cause and the location of his killers, their Chieftain makes a shocking discovery.

Athalbhar, a widower of some sixty years, has left behind an orphaned daughter barely four.  Sequestered away in a hidden dimensional safehouse amongst the man's belongings, the child is quickly taken in by the bewildered Orcs who must now determine the best course of action to care for the girl while her father's killers yet remain at large.

The danger continues to mount as Athalbhar's sworn companion, a god-child known as a Marrowvore Cockatrice rises from its grave hells-bent on meting out vengeance for its master, pitting the Chieftain's son and her trusted Outriders against the beast and its horde of undead warriors.

As a prologue novel to the series, The Death of the Briar promises an action-packed, heart-felt adventure set in a non-Golarion world in the Pathfinder universe filled with fantastic magical creatures, intimate family relations, pulse-pounding fights, and lots...

And LOTS...

Of Orcs.

**Trigger Warnings:** This work and all proceeding works may/will contain scenes of death, gore, destruction, abuse, trauma, racism, speciesism, neglect, self-harm, suicidal ideations, and more.  It is meant as a mature work for a mature audience, and though I will do my best to not aggrandize or promote any of the above mentioned aspects, it will be necessary to feature characters which at times do, and that it is necessary to feature such in my works in order to promote discussions surrounding them.  I am also doing my utmost best to include a wide variety of characters from a slew of different backgrounds, ethnicities, religious beliefs, and more, and understand that I am still very much at the mercy of my own biases and ignorance, and will be doing my level best to research and educate myself on any peoples or topics I wish to feature in my works, up to and including retconning minor details should it become apparent that I have been egregiously mistaken or misrepresentative in my writing.

**What I Am Looking For In Feedback:**

I am going to be honest here, this is the first creative piece of writing I have done in five-ever.  I will appreciate just about anything I can get from this wonderful community, even should it be piecemeal given my current manuscript's length.  That being said, here is what I am mainly looking for:

Engagement: Did you find the story interesting?  Did you like the setting, the tone, or the atmosphere?  Were there parts that jumped out at you?  What parts were super boring/needed work?

Chapter Length: This is a big one.  I know my chapter length varies right now, and I'm kinda waffling a bit on shorter vs. longer chapters what with my current plans of eventually posting my works to someplace like Royal Road.  If I need to chop or combine, let me know.

Flow: How did it read?  Did you get lost anywhere?  Was I too wordy at times?  Were the sentences just too long?

Worldbuilding and Lore: Did you feel informed enough or intrigued enough about the world to keep engaging and to read another book?  Did you feel as though you needed to know absolutely everything about Pathfinder before getting into this, or was there enough of a lead-in that you were either interested in exploring the material on your own or could go with what you were given?

POV/Clarity:  How was my POV writing?  Were you ever confused as to who was talking, or who you were following in a given chapter?

Stakes/Story:  Did the stakes seem too big for a prologue story?  Did the characters make believable decisions?

Characters:  Who was your favorite?  Who was your least favorite?  Did you just forget someone?  Did someone stand out in an odd way because they seemed out of place or were irrelevant to the story?

Language and Style:  What did you think of my writing style?  Did you find it too wordy, too repetitive, too descriptive?  Did I need more dialogue or to break up longer paragraphs?

Last, but most certainly not least...

**Would You Read the Next Book?**

I do not expect everyone to answer every single question, nor do I expect critiques without reciprocation.  I am currently working full time, and thus may be slow to respond to interested beta readers/critique swappers, but rest assured I do have my phone on me and the reddit app installed, and will be checking this post regularly for updates.  Once the ""First Page"" post goes live, feel free to give it a looksie, and I have the manuscript available as a google doc for notes, comments, and edit suggestions.

I am more than happy to swap critiques, as I mentioned earlier, and will happily look over works of a variety of genres, though I would prefer to keep my critiques to within fantasy/sci-fi if possible in order to keep my palette focused on those for the time being.

Thank you all so, so very much, and I look forward to collaborating with you in the future!",2,3,2025-09-16,NerdMetalPorter,>100k,1.0
"[Complete] [148,000] [Historical Fiction] Achille Lauro/Naval Strike Operations in Time of Peace","I’ve just completed the draft manuscript of an historical fiction military thriller, which has a Christian theme. I am looking for three men and three women to be beta readers for the book prior to it going to developmental editing.

Please see the summary below and let me know if you’re interested.

Achille Lauro is first in the ""Naval Strike"" series of books about the men and women of the U.S. Navy and those who love them. It's for those interested in historical military operations in times of peace. It will appeal to readers who want to see beyond cynical headlines and read a story that celebrates the heroism of those who worked in the shadows during a time of transformational change and emerging threats. Those who read this story enjoy great action and adventure, but also want to learn how a man of faith responds to adversity and how a person without faith could come to experience Christ in times of crisis.

For context, the story is about a girl named Samantha who lives in a small rural, religious town where everyone believes she is the problem for the mistakes.

**Chapter One**

Fresh off four weeks in the Seychelles and a personal record-breaking seven different conquests from five different countries, Michael Angelo Sylvestri was surveying the Philly Capital Grille bar, doing what he did best: assessing which of the attractive women he was observing would be most susceptible to his charms. An entertaining but perhaps unnecessary exercise, considering Michael’s matinee idol looks with eyes that could charm a cat into swimming lessons.

Although highly intelligent—he acquired a Wharton MBA in the prescribed 5 years despite numerous distractions, usually wearing short skirts—said intelligence was rarely displayed in his love life. He’d abdicated those decisions at age fourteen to his little head, nicknamed Monty, as in Python. Yes, Michael had a slightly twisted sense of humor. Nevertheless, Michael’s big head and little head had lived in blissful synchronicity—17 lust-filled years—rarely butting heads. 

He'd settled on the striking brunette at the far end of the bar but was distracted by a fellow talent scout a few seats to his right, shielded by other patrons. “Hi I’m Roger, can I buy you a drink?” Michael quickly dismissed him as an amateur. Such an unimaginative opening line invited rejection.  

Michael, would use a relevant non-threatening conversation starter. Like: *Feels more like May out there than October.* At some point during the ensuing weather conversation, which would segue into a fascinating litany of Michael’s romantic, weather-perfect, travel destinations, she’d need another drink and he’d put it in on his check. Then the mating dance would begin. Smooth. Truthfully, when you looked like Michael, if your opening line was, “Jeez what an ugly dress”, she’d likely reply, with a smile, “Maybe I should take it off, then.”",2,3,2025-09-15,rtrecchiuti,80k,1.0

Hi, everyone. i hope you're having a great day.

I wrote this chapter after years of planning my epic fantasy tale and building the world. I have written short stories and other works before, but I never dared to put my passion world into words because I feared I was not good enough yet.

Now that I found the courage to do it, I need some feedback too see what's strong and if something needs refinement.

Overall, my subjective view sees this chapter as kinda good. I tried my best at doing this ""show, don't tell"" thing, but let some ""telling"" moments slip because I believe they're necessary for readers to breathe.

My goal was to set a gritty tone for the world using words and sensory details. I hope I did an okay job at that.

Please feel free to read the chapter and tell me your thoughts! Thank you!

There is nothing that Rosie Williams would like to do less than spend the summer on the rodeo circuit with her enigmatic stepbrother. Hayes has flitted in and out of her life since she was a kid and joined the military the second she turned eighteen. Twelve years later and he’s back, ready to spend his summer as a pickup rider on the Pro Rodeo Cowboy circuit, protecting bronc riders like her from harm.

But Rosie is all grown up now and after so many years apart, there’s undeniable chemistry between the two. Rosie is an icon in her own right. She's the The Wild of the West, one of the best saddle bronc riders to hit the circuit in years. As a female rodeo athlete, she’s under constant scrutiny from the fans and the media alike.

When a reporter catches Rosie and Hayes in a compromising position, the fallout threatens to bring them irreparable ruin. Backed into a corner, there is no way to escape the magnifying glass the rodeo world has put them under. Over hundreds of miles, hours in the saddle, and the knowledge that they could be exposed at any moment, the pressure consumes Rosie and Hayes.

In this contemporary western romance, they must decide if what they have is worth the price they’ll pay to stay together. The Wild of the West is the final book in the Cowboys of Cobalt Creek series and occurs sixteen years after the previous book ends. Like all the books in the series, it can be read as a standalone.

🤔 why do we tend to grow further apart from childhood memories?

🤔 why do we find small moments of happiness more fulfilling?

I'm looking for readers of my messy girl contemporary fiction, Stars Don't Kneel. I am looking for feedback on pacing, dialogue, and characterization. And really, everything! 

Blurb:

Senior year was supposed to be Erin Spenser’s chance to shine. Instead, she’s drowning in failing grades, ADHD chaos, and the weight of academic probation that could cost her both graduation and her band’s shot at local success.

The one place Erin feels alive is with Veritas—the messy, loud, makeshift family she’s built with her best friends. And with Trent Fisher, her best friend’s reckless, magnetic confidante, who makes her believe she’s more than her report card and her mistakes. Their chemistry is undeniable, intoxicating, impossible to ignore.

But as rehearsals blur into romance, Erin’s grip on everything else begins to slip. Missed study sessions. Frustrated friends. A heartbreak that threatens to shatter not just Erin, but the band itself. To survive senior year, she’ll have to face her flaws head-on—on stage, in the classroom, and in her own heart.

Messy, heartfelt, and music-fueled, Stars Don’t Kneel is a story of ambition, first love, and finding your voice in a world determined to silence it.

Content warning: mentions of religion, some minor spice, substance misuse

I can send the Google link for you if you're interested! I have trouble reading on screens, so I'm not sure if I am able to reciprocate (vision issues), but I can certainly try!

Brief excerpt:

Chapter One – “Alarm Bells”	

There’s a very specific shame that comes with waking up in the stall of a school bathroom, crumpled hoodie for a pillow, and an unfinished algebra worksheet sticking to the side of your face. I blinked at the aggressive sound of the period bell, unsure if it was still morning, the afternoon, or the afterlife. 

I pulled myself up from the floor, brain and body both in protest. But there was only so much dignity I was willing to give up, so no more bathroom floor naps for today. Everything in me was a bundle of anxiety, burnout, and the curse of being eighteen and perpetually behind on everything, the threat of bombing senior year hanging over my head like the proverbial sword of Damocles. 

I yanked open the stall door, trying to remember which class I’d bailed on this time. Biology? English? Judgement Day?
 
As if it heard my thoughts, the intercom crackled – the halls didn’t drown it out, so that must have been the tardy bell– and I heard the voice every student dreads: the vice principal. Mr. McCreary, the walking migraine. “Erin Spenser, report to McCreary’s office immediately. Erin Spenser.” Repeating it, just in case I missed the embarrassment the first time. So thoughtful, that McCreary. Someone must have reported my absence.I shoved the wrinkled hoodie on top of my uniform –another thing for McCreary to get onto me about – and trudged the familiar path to his office. The buzzing fluorescent lights and stern paintings of saints judged me with each step. 

I knocked on the door of the office, making the crucifix rattle just slightly against the wood. You’d think he’d want to make Jesus a little more secure, but I guess he liked living his life on the edge.

 “Erin, come in. Sit down.” 

We had a routine, McCreary and me. He’d say, “Erin, sit down,” and I would pick the same seat each time. He’d say whatever I’d screwed up, I’d pretend it didn’t bother me, he’d give me my punishment, and we’d mutually agree to do this again the same time next week. “Mrs. Cormier told me you fell asleep in her class.” He frowned like I’d insulted his tie. “Again.” 

Cormier. Religion. Which means I made it to fourth hour before disappearing into the nap from the netherworld. “I’m just… really tired,” I muttered, knowing what was coming next. “It’s not like I did it on purpose.”

“And you were marked absent for Mr. Boudreaux’s history class last hour. Care to explain that?” 

“Not really,” I retorted before I could even think about it. 

“Watch your tone, Ms. Spenser.” He pointed a finger at me, his frown lines deepening. 

I shifted in my seat, fingers finding the beads on my bracelet and spinning them. “Sorry.” 

“You were cutting class in the bathroom again.” It wasn’t a question. This man just had ways of knowing things. It was creepy as hell. I felt the heat flush in my face. 

""I didn’t plan to,” I said, still exhausted in
 every way. “It just happened.” 

""That’s the problem, Erin. You don’t plan, you just let things happen. This is why your GPA is in serious danger.” 

It took every ounce of willpower I had left in me to not roll my eyes. If one more adult in this office harped on my GPA, I was going to throw a one-woman riot. I knew my GPA sucked; did they really think harping on me about it would magically make me able to fix it? My thumb spun the star-shaped fidget ring on my right hand. 

McCreary twisted his computer screen around to show me my grades. “We’ve been back in school for a week, and you already have six missing assignments. I know senioritis is tough, but you understand how serious this is, right? No work, no passing grades. No passing grades, no graduation.” 

Yes, thank you for that. I know how school works. Kind of been in it a few years now, is what I wished I could have said. But instead I forced out, “Yes, sir.”

“You’ve got another lunch detention,” he told me. A weight lifted slightly from within me. Could’ve been much worse. “And I’ll be talking with both your parents. We’re going to be scheduling a meeting to discuss your path to graduation soon.” Never mind, then. With those words, it got way, way worse. 

I could’ve cried. Or argued. Or run. Instead, I stared at the ugly floor tiles and said the one thing that always came easy at the end of these conversations: “Cool. Can I go now?” 

“Hand over your hoodie first. It’s not uniform.” 

I didn’t hide my eye roll when I plopped the Breaking Benjamin hoodie onto his desk. Hopefully my dad would pick it up for me later, when McCreary talked to him about me… again. 

They really didn’t get that I was drowning. And each time they added something that they thought would help me get myself together – detentions of so many various kinds – it just made things worse. 

I took the long way to what I was pretty sure was my next class– I didn’t want to lower myself to ask McCreary what hour it was – and used the walk to set my face to “fine” again. The last thing I wanted was people getting their nose into my business, not like this. They wanted to know about me and what I was going through, they could listen to my music. My music told everything.

**Blurb:**

Laura Bellamy escapes an abusive relationship and is guided through life to begin again. She struggles with resistance and surrender before discovering a mystifying spirit world around her. As she settles into Hummingbird Hostel, symbols, coincidences, and a touch of mystery lead Laura to the midwife who helped her into the world. Roseland, who knew her two times great grandfather, ignites the spark for the medicine within which provides her with the power to continuing moving forward in Roseland's old city apartment. Laura meets a group of artists who carry her through the changes, discovering a man who knew the painting in the basement of Ethan McCallister's house. He claimed his grandmother was lost in it in 1934. Together, James Riley and Laura Bellamy step into the Great Mystery to discover what happened to them and discover their psychic potential. James sees back in time and Laura sees the future where her grandfather returns as a baby to James' grandmother.

**Excerpt:**

Ethan McCallister walked through the door, startling his fiancé Laura Bellamy. She sliced her finger cutting potatoes for his dinner.

“Clumsy mess, as usual,” he said. Ethan kicked off his shoes and left them in disorder at the front door. He pushed her aside as he looked over the spices she’d chosen for dinner- she cheated again with a pre-made blend, “Can’t you think of anything better?”

The red in her face filled Ethan’s egoic cup enough to let her finish while he pulled a beer from the fridge. The rainbow can took him by surprise next to his usual pack of Budweiser. He pulled it out anyway, shoving brushing briskly by her, too close for comfort, already ready to drop more ridicule into her offering.

Everything she did was for him. It always was. From somewhere deep inside- a shy little girl, desperate to please- had gone out of her way to purchase the individual spices she needed to surprise him with the homemade blend after his last blow up about her shitty dinners. They remained hidden in the red grocery bag sitting on the counter and he didn’t take one pause to notice.

Laura gently placed a plaster over the cut and kept chopping. Despite having thought about it for months, trying to build up her confidence to stand her ground, she knew dinner was not a place to challenge a man. Laura cut the peppers, slower than usual, as he sat on the couch to take a sip.

Ethan spit the beer out of his mouth before it had even fully crossed his palette, “What is this shit?”

“You bought it while you were high,” she said without turning around. Laura Bellamy was shaking inside, but she’d built up a tolerance and sometimes blunt truth kept her out of the target line. Sometimes it didn’t, but today, she held a knife in her hand which she gripped even tighter feeling her power.",3,2,2025-09-14,deleted,Short Story,0.8

[Complete] [137k] [Upmarket Novel] JANE'S WAKE,"I’m looking for two or three lesbian readers to help shape a complete draft of my novel, *Jane’s Wake*. The manuscript is complete, but not finalized; I’m still refining its structure, emotional tone, and appeal.

*Jane’s Wake* is an upmarket cultural drama about legacy, voice, and power. 

It centers on Janis Mallory, a trans woman uncovering her late mother’s hidden art, and the struggles over how her mother’s work and voice are remembered. At its heart are queer intimacy, erotic tension, and a bit of razzle-dazzle from the avatar of our protagonist’s dead mother brought back to Turing-level senescence. There are hidden rooms, lost art, personal power, a gigantic beehive, and the politics of silenced voices being reclaimed. The book addresses toxic male arrogance and misogyny.

*What I’m asking**:*

* To read the manuscript in full from a secured PDF file. 
* To give candid feedback on where the book rings true or false… especially in its portrayal of intimacy, attraction, and queer dynamics.
* To flag moments that feel misdirected or written from the wrong gaze.
* To provide an overall rating for how much you liked the book, whether it moved at a comfortable pace, and whether you would recommend it to others.

*What you’d get**:*

* Early access to a novel that takes lesbian and queer voices seriously.
* The chance to influence it while it’s still malleable.
* My thanks and acknowledgment in the finished work (or anonymity, if you prefer).

This is alpha reading: not a proofread, and certainly not a line edit, but the stage where your insight can genuinely reshape the book. If that excites you, I’d love to hear from you.

[Complete] [75000] [Horror] The House of Turpentine,"Hi everyone! I'm looking for a beat reader for my horror novel. What I'm looking for is something akin to structural feedback. I have a full list of questions that I can provide to beta readers along with the manuscript.

Trigger warnings for death, suicide, body horror.

**Synopsis:**

Once a promising painter, Alistair Humboldt watched his career collapse under the weight of impossible comparisons to his uncle, the renowned artist Sir John Humboldt. He abandoned his dreams of artistic glory until Sir John’s sudden and violent suicide leaves him heir to Caligo, a vast and decaying estate in the English countryside.

In his uncle’s locked studio, Alistair uncovers a series of strange, unfinished canvases depicting a headless statue. Something about them inspires him. Compelled to paint, he finds himself painting with a brilliance he never possessed before.

But the talent is not his own.

An ancient evil that tormented his uncle now guides Alistair’s hand, using his art as a doorway into his world. As his canvases grow in power, so too does its hold over him, until Alistair must face a terrible choice: claim the genius he always longed for or unleash the end of everything.

**First chapter:**

*Nineveh, Mesopotamia, 1543*

He starts digging with a shovel and when he comes across it, a slab of stone swallowed whole by the ground, Yusef begins to dig with his hands. He steps back and presses a rag to his lips, contemplating what such a discovery might mean. There have been rumours for centuries of an ancient temple buried beneath the sands of Nineveh. Kings and scholars have spent their lives searching for it and found nothing.

*And here I’ve just happened to stumble across it.*

He can buy new sandals and no longer have to wear the ones that have been patched together with strips of inferior leather. A house of stone. A place for Zainab and Fatima to grow up in safety.

His brother, Habbas, stands on a sand-swept ridge not too far away. His features are washed in the silver light of the crescent moon. Yuesf calls to him.

“What?”

“Come over here and help me dig. I’ve found something.”

The two men dig. The sand divides and falls away until both men are looking at stone steps, disappearing into the belly of the earth. 

“Do you see?”

Habbas nods. Yusef holds his brother tight against him and lets out a cry of joy.

“We have made it, brother. We have finally found our fortune.”

They start their descent, locking their eyes on the dark opening at the foot of the stone stairs. Cold, musty air rolls out from it, the very breath of the earth itself. Yusef goes first, clutching a torch in his hand. Habbas follows reluctantly behind.

At the bottom is a chamber. The walls are bare and sand covers the floor. Against the far wall, set high on a dais of black stone, is a painting.

Yusef’s torch sputters.

He wonders how long it has stood there waiting to be found. The colours have not faded. They are bright and vivid, almost impossibly so. The surface shimmers slightly as if the artist has put his brush down only minutes earlier. It shows a statue sitting atop a throne in some great, ancient hall. Where its head should be, there is only a jagged stump of white rock.

Habbas approaches. His face twists.

“I thought there was going to be gold.”

“Brother-”

“You said there would be jewels. You said I would be as rich as Mansa Musa.”

Yusef says nothing. His gaze lingers on the canvas and his guts harden to rock. There is something about the painting that horrifies. Something that he cannot quite put into words. It is not a sight or a sound or even a smell. It is a sense that he is looking at a doorway and that there is something waiting for him on the other side. Something formless and immense.

The hairs rise on the back of his neck. He wants to look away but can’t. Every single part of his body has betrayed him. 

And then, as faint as the winds that come off the mountains around Nineveh, comes a voice.

*Paint.*

Yusef reels as if struck. The painting quivers in the corner of his vision and for a sickening instant, he is sure he sees the brushstrokes shift, as if the statue were about to stand up from its throne.

*Paint. Paint. Bring me forth.*

Habbas steps forward and holds his torch up to the painting. “Perhaps we may sell it in town. Some rich man may want to display it at his home.”

“No.” Yusef says. His voice trembles and he tries hard to thread it with steel. “No. We forget what we found. Let the sand reclaim this place.”

Habbas looks back at the painting. “But you said-”

Yusef seizes his brother by the shoulders and shakes him. “Stop! Do not look at it!”

“But-”

“Tell me you do not know what we’ve found. Tell me that you cannot feel it.”

“Feel what?”

He steals a fragmentary glance at the painting. Anything more than that and he is utterly, utterly certain that it will kill him.

*Evil.*

Yusef steadies himself. “We leave it. We bury it. We tell no one. There will be other finds, brother. Other jewels and golds that will make us rich.”

The silence presses on them and Yusef that they were home in Nineveh. He may complain about the noise and the stench and the neighbours who allow their donkey to foul his doorstep, but now he wants nothing more than that world. He wants nothing more than to sink into sleep and awake in the morning to discover that all memory of this cursed place has vanished like smoke. 

*By Allah, what have we found?*

He fixes his younger brother with a hard gaze. “Swear to me. Swear you will never speak of this. That no soul shall ever know.”

Habbas hesitates and then nods. “I swear.”

General impressions/critique for the first ten pages of this first chapter, please. Any thoughts are welcome. 

**Summary** - Eight years since everyone he has ever loved and cared for was massacred, sixteen-year-old Kevin Miller still hasn't managed to take a simple nap without that day playing out in his mind with hauntingly vivid detail. But for the past two months, this nightmare has been plagued by the appearance of someone who can't possibly be real. Someone who brings with him an impossible promise of a life with the best friend he lost all those years ago, and a warning of things to come.

They're not something you need to look at unless you want to compare.))!<

**Excerpt**

>Kevin Miller, nearly eight years old, stands in the shade of a willow tree at the lake’s edge in Enfield Park, with his best friend, Zoey O’Neill. Born just barely a day apart, ‘inseparable’ is often the word used to describe them, since one is rarely seen without the other.

>Zoey's presence is normally calming and comforting for Kevin, but all he feels right now is embarrassed and a little anxious. However, she isn't the cause. Her almost seventeen-year-old sister, Julia, is responsible for the way he feels. She's also the reason he doesn't even have to look to know everyone in the park is staring at him and Zoey. But, being the glutton for punishment that his mother says he is, he takes a breath and looks anyway- just to confirm he's humiliated enough.

>Surprisingly, not everyone is paying attention to them. In fact, most of the kids are spending their Summer Solstice swimming, or chasing and soaking each other with their bespoke water spell wands. And most of their parents are chatting, eating, and relaxing beneath the shade trees. But he wasn't entirely wrong, as more than a few people are shamelessly watching in amusement while he plays his part in the story that Julia has forced them to act out. Even his and Zoey's parents, who are sitting together halfway across the park, have roped in other parents to watch. Fewer people are watching than he expected, but he doesn't think he was humiliated enough before.

>He looks away from them and to his left at Julia, who's sitting on the nearby bench with a children's storybook on her crossed legs. She is a kind, fashionable girl whose style Zoey loves to copy. This is something Julia genuinely seems to enjoy, as she often goes out of her way to pick matching outfits just to make her sister happy, like today's white, knee-length, high-waisted dresses, which put the biggest smile on Zoey's face when she saw them. Even for sisters, they're so similar that apart from the age and height difference- and Julia’s much longer, glossy black hair- the two are practically twins.

>Julia gestures for him to continue, but with a whine, Kevin asks, “Do I really have to do this here?”

>“You do if you wanna learn another spell. Go on. Hurry up and say your lines, then kiss my adorable, beautiful little sister before you have to meet that guy.”

>He closes his eyes as he tilts his head back to groan, but a tug on the sleeve of his white button-up stops him short. When he lowers his head and looks over, Zoey's gazing up at him, her big, green eyes seeming uncertain as they search his face.

>With a frown and furrowed brow, she quietly asks, “Is it me? Do you think I'm ugly?”

>“Wha- no! I- I didn’t mean-”   He drops to his knee so quickly that when it hits the ground, he has to fight the urge to wince. He clears his throat and asks, “Were you harmed, princess?”

>A smile spreads across Zoey's face, and she shakes her head. “Thanks to you, he didn’t have the chance! You’re a hero!”

[In Progress][110k][Romance/Fantasy] Pearl Bay,"In progress only due to massive edits. I’m hoping to slim up the word count by taking out unnecessary bits. The title is also not set, I haven’t found one that sticks. This story started off as something I’d scribble about with when I had writers block while trying a write a more marketable book. I dropped everything else I was working on because I started having way too much fun with this story.

I’m super new at this so please be patient if I don’t describe things right. My world is a fictional fantasy universe where magic and monsters run amok on top of a ridiculous war that’s lasted centuries between two countries. My leading lady is a retired “entertainer” who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and is now in my universes take on witness protection. She accepted a job as a town witch, whose duties usually involve protecting the town from monsters and helping with various other bits of magic. Only, while she is technically a witch, she’s never been able to use any magic other than a charm (a specific type of magic that alters thoughts/emotions). The town she was sent to also isn’t super thrilled about magic in general and the last town witch didn’t leave a good impression. 

Then comes my MMC…the town doctor who not only looks down on magic users but has a pretty traumatic history with witches. His grandmother was the last town witch. Despite his resistance to magic, he is a seer (someone who cannot use magic but sees into the future when triggered). His visions come at a cost, as he only sees things that lead to death and tragedy…so when he starts having steamy visions of a certain witch’s hands and lips in peculiarly places he is left with some big emotions.

Since it’s a fantasy world with magic, time is a bit different than real life but if I had to pick a year it would be around 1920-1940s. Some technology has boomed with magic and other advancements unnecessary. I don’t want to waste anyone’s time so I thought I’d add the disclaimer that I have multiple gay characters, a polytheistic pantheon, and some darker themes. There is some alluding to SA, self-harm, and sexism plays a big part of my FMC’s trauma. I also have a few scenes that border the line between fantasy and horror. My smut sciences could use some work but I prefer the romantic approach over erotic (but I read both).

I’d love to do a chapter for chapter swap with anyone with a work in a similar genre! If you want to read the whole thing that’s cool too.

[Complete] [82k] [Women's Fiction] Life After Life,"Frankie Moore’s mother — Nora, the once-beloved psychic TV star — has always been an enigma. So when she dies suddenly, it’s no surprise that she leaves behind more questions than answers. Frankie’s inheritance is a mysterious East Village address and a stack of letters, each tied to a location in New York City, and a condition in her will: Frankie must follow the trail.

In the present, Frankie navigates a city full of strangers who might hold the keys to her past — including a guarded teenager, a snarky barista, and a washed-up musician who knew Nora long before her fame. In the past, a young Nora arrives in New York with nothing but a duffel bag and a gift she’s still learning to control, falling into a world of punk bars, magic shops, and fierce, fragile friendships. As the letters pull Frankie deeper into the life Nora never talked about, she begins to suspect the mystery isn’t just about her mother’s youth — it’s about her own identity, and secrets that have the power to change everything.

Told through interwoven timelines and intimate prose, *Life After Life* is a story of mothers and daughters, found and fractured families, and the truths we carry even when it’s too late to speak them aloud. The perfect blend of *Daisy Jones & The Six* and *The Rules of Magic*, *L*i*fe After Life* is a dual-timeline literary mystery that blends the electric pulse of New York’s 1990s punk scene with the bittersweet journey of a daughter uncovering the life her mother left behind—and building a life of her own in the process.

**Feedback wanted:** Looking for feedback about characters and plot. Especially curious if the plot makes sense (any holes?) flows well and feels suspenseful, and if Nora as a character is too unlikeable. Also any title suggestions if you're good at titles because I am not!!

**Blurb**: He woke beside a murdered girl. Blood on the floor. No memory of how he got there.

When Wayne wakes beside the body of a dead girl on Yale’s campus, he’s arrested as the prime suspect and forced to relive the night that shattered his life. But the past doesn’t stay buried—this time, it’s happening again.

What begins as a murder charge unravels into a conspiracy far bigger than anyone suspects, stretching beyond Ivy League walls into an international web of secrets and sabotage.

As the investigation spirals, Wayne is pulled deeper into encrypted files, buried histories, and enemies who will do anything to silence him. His gift is seeing what no one else sees—hidden codes, subtle patterns, connections others miss. Every clue brings him closer to the truth… and closer to danger.

*Dark Memories* is a gripping techno-thriller about memory, betrayal, and global destruction. With the past closing in, one question remains: can Wayne uncover the truth before the world turns against him?

**Details**: This new series has been likened to books in the genre of Michael Crichton, David Baldacci, and Lee Child.

**Who is the book for:** Readers who enjoy modern origin stories and gritty mysteries with a technological twist. Fans of contemporary thrillers like the Jack Reacher series or character-driven crime dramas will connect with Wayne's journey. It will particularly resonate with those who appreciate a slow-burn narrative focused on a protagonist's psychological transformation from a lost young adult into a determined hero.

[In Progress] [32k] [Historical Gothic/Sapphic Romance/Supernatural] As the Black Lily Fades,"Hi everyone!  
I'm looking for 2-3 beta readers for the first portion of my historical gothic novel. I am looking to submit this excerpt to a writing competition that rewards literary/genre blends (\~32k of \~90k total words).  If you enjoy slow-burn sapphic romance, supernatural/folkloric horror and character rich fiction, please read on!

**Blurb:**

Bridgette Fletcher is a dry-witted apothecary’s daughter burdened by duty, small-town gossip, and a curse she doesn’t believe in. When she discovers a half-dead woman in the woods during a storm, she brings her home. Unbeknownst to her, Elisabeth Schwarz carries a darkness far older and more seductive than anything the town of Wychurst has seen before.

As the women grow closer, Bridgette finds herself torn between what she knows and what she feels. Elisabeth is ethereal, unfathomable, and increasingly unignorable. When the ancient salt well runs dry and townsfolk begin to die, Bridgette must confront her growing desire and the rising suspicion that something unnatural is stirring.

Caught between love, fear, and the haunting pull of her own past, Bridgette is forced to do the one thing she swore she never would: descend into the abandoned mine and face the demons that live beneath - and within - her.

For readers of Sarah Waters and V.E. Schwab, *As the Black Lily Fades* is a historical gothic novel exploring forbidden intimacy, moral ambiguity, and the quiet horror of transformation.

**First Page Sample:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/BetaReaders/comments/1n5ik6u/comment/ndm0b9f/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BetaReaders/comments/1n5ik6u/comment/ndm0b9f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

**Trigger Warnings:**

·       Period appropriate misogyny and homophobia

·       Class-based power dynamics

·       Power imbalance and age difference in a romantic relationship

·       Suicide ideation by poisoning (named character)

·       Supernatural dread

·       Anxiety/panic attack (from POV character)

·       Some gore, including blood consumption

·       Alcohol use (and hangover)

·       Physical intimacy between two women (sensual, emotionally explicit, non-anatomical)

·       Death of a parent (both on and off-page)

·       Murder (on-page)

·       Animal death (brief, not gratuitous)

·       Attendance of a Christian (Anglican) church service

What I’m Looking for in Feedback:

As this is a partial draft (about 32.5k words / \~130 pages), I’m especially hoping for feedback that will help shape the next stages. I’m aiming to submit this for the Lucy Cavendish Fiction Prize, so early impressions are invaluable – ideally before the end of October. In particular, I’d love insight on:

Engagement and tone: Are you hooked by the atmosphere, characters, and pacing? Do you feel pulled into the world?

Character connection: Do you care about Bridgette and Elisabeth? Are their dynamics believable and emotionally compelling?

Romantic development: Is the slow-burn romance working? Are the moments of intimacy (e.g. the kiss scene) emotionally earned and tonally appropriate?

Worldbuilding and lore: Do the folkloric elements (e.g. the salt, the well, the mine, Isabel, the tree) feel intriguing and coherent?

Pacing and tension: Are there any parts that feel too slow, confusing, or overwritten? Where does your attention flag?

Clarity of stakes: Do you understand what’s at risk for Bridgette—emotionally, morally, and physically?

Thematic cohesion: Does the mix of gothic, queer romance, and supernatural horror feel cohesive or disjointed?

Language and style: I welcome any comments on clarity, repetition, or purple prose (especially if anything feels too overwritten or flat).

And finally:

Would you keep reading?

 

You don’t need to answer all of these—any honest thoughts are appreciated, whether as margin notes or a few bullet points at the end.

I am also very happy to swap critiques, especially if you are working in adjacent genres (gothic, historical, queer fiction, slow-burn romance, fantasy etc)

Thanks so much for considering! Please feel free to DM if you’re interested.",6,3,2025-09-11,sharkbaitlha,Novella,0.87

[Complete] [86k] [Post-Apocalyptic Thriller] Salt & Bone,"**Blurb:**

>When the virus hit, doctors assumed it was just rabies. It wasn’t.

>Hospitals filled, the grid collapsed, and the rules of survival rewrote themselves overnight.

>Now Dr. Lisa Calloway is patching wounds with vodka and keeping her two kids alive on instinct, while Jack Reynolds, a mechanic with more baggage than bullets, wrestles with ghosts of his past as the outbreak closes in.

>In a world where silence has teeth and trust can kill you, survival isn’t about being the strongest. It’s about who you’re willing to become when the world is reduced to salt and bone.

**Short Excerpt:**

>The phones stopped ringing first. Landlines. Cell towers. A few scattered signals, then static, then nothing at all.

>Hospitals filled fast—first the fevers, then the seizures, then the screaming. The ones who didn’t get admitted died at home, slumped over kitchen tables or curled up in bathtubs, their skin cracked and dry as parchment. By the time the National Guard arrived, there were too many to move.

>People began locking their doors, pulling curtains tight, whispering through cracked windows. Neighbors turned strangers overnight. The power grid stuttered, then failed—lights flickering once, twice, then going dark for good. The water ran until it didn’t. The shelves emptied.

>It wasn’t the sick that got to them first—it was the hunger. The thirst. The grinding panic in the chest when there was no one left to answer the call.

**Content Warnings:** Violence, gore, references to medical trauma, death of side characters, language.

**Type of Feedback Requested:** I’m primarily looking for *big-picture feedback* on pacing, character engagement, and believability of motivations. Do the survival choices feel authentic? Do the characters feel flawed but human? General reader reaction is very welcome, but I’m especially interested in:

* Whether the dual POV (Lisa and Jack) balances well.
* If the tension sustains across quieter, character-driven chapters.
* Any moments where you felt lost, skimmed, or disconnected.

**Timeline:** I’m hoping for feedback within *2-4 weeks***.** Partial feedback in chunks (every 5–10 chapters) is fine and even preferred, so I can adjust earlier if needed.

**Critique Swap:** I’m open to swaps! I primarily read speculative fiction, thrillers, and horror, but I’m happy to consider other genres if you’re looking for feedback.

I am still in progress drafting my medieval-Alpine Romantasy, *Heir of Salt and Silver,* and would super appreciate some feedback on whether it's (whatsoever) readable, semi-interesting, or if I should scrap it and start fresh.

  
**The premise**: Irene, the overworked daughter of the Salt Lord, has secretly been managing the Salt Keep and the city of Hallenheim in her ailing father's stead. While trying to balance the petty demands of the other Mineral Lords and support the needs of the commoners, she is gobsmacked when her underground neighbors demand an overhaul of the long-standing human-goblin accords. 

When her magical castle leads her to a tunnel deep in the mountain, she discovers that the goblins are most certainly not to be trusted. Armed with unexpected new allies, like a group of commoners unaware of her noble blood, and the mysterious new goblin ambassador, who has a secret of his own, Irene must navigate murky political waters before she loses her position for good--and all of Hallenheim unravels.

Collection:   
**\[Atlas Note: Look up, and the rafters dissolve into endless shelves, their titles glowing like constellations you cannot name\]**

**I.** ***The Library of Unspoken Tongues***

The shelves stretch past sight, endless as a horizon,  
every spine stamped in gold with your own name.  
A thousand versions of yourself stacked shoulder to shoulder,  
but not one story opens to something you can read.

Pages unfurl into glyphs—curved bones, broken stars,  
letters that twist back on themselves like snakes.  
You trace the margins, waiting for sound,  
but only silence answers,  
thick as dust in your lungs.

The air smells of ink and mildew,  
the weight of forgotten centuries pressing down.  
You walk the aisles as if they were streets,  
each turn leading deeper,  
each book a mirror refusing your reflection.

Your heart stutters loud enough to echo,  
the only language this library grants you.

**\[Atlas Note: Turn left, where pale shards glimmer in the soil, as though the earth itself is gnawing on secrets.\]**

**II.** ***Seeds of Teeth***

Teeth fall from my mouth,  
palms cradle them—roots erupt,  
green shoots pierce the skin.

**\[Atlas Note: Step right into the square, where the air shivers as if one voice still lingers after the crowd has vanished.\]**

**III.** ***The Stranger’s Greeting***

He grips my arm as though we’ve always known,  
a steady hand that burns against my sleeve.  
He calls me by a name I’ve never owned,  
a sound so sharp it makes my ribcage heave.

The syllables unlock some buried gate,  
a chamber where my pulse begins to race.  
Am I the self he swears is bound by fate,  
or just a mask that mirrors some lost face?

The crowd moves on, but he will not release.  
His voice insistent, filled with aching need.  
I wonder if this stranger brings me peace  
or plants confusion like a sprouting seed.

A name unknown, yet spoken like a prayer—  
I answer, though it leads me nowhere.

**\[Atlas Note: Look behind you—the sky droops low, and the moon leans close enough to stain your shadow silver.\]**

**IV.** ***Moon Descent***

Moon leans too near earth—  
I see walkers wave at me,  
their steps soft as dust.

**\[\[Atlas Note: Climb halfway up, and the steps sag like softened wax, the railing sighing beneath your grip.\]**

**V.** ***The Melting Stairs***

I begin with purpose, a climb toward the unseen floor.  
But each stair droops like candle wax in heat,  
solid wood sagging into a slick slide.

My palms scrape the railings; they flex like vines.  
The higher I reach, the more they bend,  
the staircase softening, collapsing,  
a toy rebuilt in motion,  
a ladder in a dream that will not let me rise.

Every ascent tumbles me downward.  
I laugh between clenched teeth—  
Or is it panic hiding in laughter’s mask?  
Knees bruised, breath ragged,  
I keep climbing, stubborn against the melt.

The stairs taunt me with their molten grin:  
ambition is only wax,  
and gravity is always waiting.

**\[Atlas Note: Turn around, and the doorway returns you to the same dim carpet, the same waiting silence, as if the room has learned your name.\]**

**VI.** ***The Door Within the Door***

A knob turns smooth, the hinges sigh with grace,  
yet stepping through delivers me again.  
The room unchanged, the carpet, every face  
of clock and lamp repeat as they had been.

I circle, grasp another handle near,  
Its brass is warm, a portal surely new.  
But still the walls return me here, austere,  
a labyrinth whose center has no clue.

Perhaps the door is not a way but a will,  
a test of faith disguised as common wood.  
If I believe the threshold bends, it will—  
If not, I’m rooted where I’ve always stood.

So I keep opening and turning still,  
until the room believes escape is good.

In the heart of a world torn in two, lies the Threshold - a mysterious border where eternal light and endless dark touch, yet never merge; an ancient and unseen seam separating two kingdoms that never meet.

The Queen of the Nightrealm rules her kingdom with cold might, while the darkness conceals secrets that threaten her reign and her very life. On the other side, the Queen of the Lightrealm fights to protect her realm from internal schemes and hidden threats that seek to shatter her luminous world.

""Ballad of the Threshold"" is a sweeping tale of elusive borders, intertwined fates, and characters struggling to find their way through a maze of loyalties and betrayals, before the entire world is plunged into darkness - or consumed by light.

[Complete] [79k] [Urban Fantasy/Romance] The Spaces Between,"I've been working on this novel for 2 years and am looking for beta readers who love urban fantasy and paranormal romance!

**Story Blurb:**

Nyx and Aether should be natural enemies. She's an Ignithari: a demon whose inner light makes her an outcast in Hell. He's an Eternum: an angel whose darkness marks him as defective in Heaven. When mythology professor Eden Thorne is murdered during a lecture on ancient prophecies, these two reluctant outcasts find themselves thrown together by circumstances neither expected. What starts as hesitant cooperation becomes something neither realm has a name for, as they discover their supposed flaws might be exactly what an ancient prophecy has been waiting for. But as their connection deepens and reality begins to fracture around them, they must choose: remain loyal to the realms that reject them, or risk everything for a bond that could either save all worlds—or destroy them.

**Content Warnings:**

* Moderate fantasy violence (including a murder scene, supernatural combat, and mentions that a particular mission may be 'suicidal')
* Romance/Emotional Intimacy
* Themes of religious/cosmic conflict (note: while drawing some inspiration from traditional sources, this creates its own unique mythology rather than following standard Christian/religious tropes)

**Type of Feedback I'm Looking For:**

I'm primarily seeking general reader reaction and pacing feedback. Specific areas I'd appreciate input on:

* Does the world-building feel cohesive and immersive without being overwhelming?
* Are the romantic/relationship developments believable given the supernatural circumstances?
* Does the mystery surrounding the prophecy maintain tension throughout?
* How well do the fantasy elements integrate with the modern urban setting?
* Are Nyx and Aether's character arcs satisfying and well-developed?

I'm also interested in any plot holes you might catch or areas where motivations feel unclear.

**Short Excerpt:**

*The skies above had been wrong for weeks.*

*With coffee cooling on the table, Eden Thorne, in her pajamas, sat on her apartment balcony, marveling at the improbably intricate cloud formations. Across the horizon, perfect geometric shapes stretched, dissolved and reformed with incredible mathematical precision. A strange calm lingered in the morning air, like the world itself was paused, holding its breath.*

*No one else seemed to notice.*

*She'd checked every scientific outlet available to her, examined every weather service and even scoured social media platforms. Nothing. Just complaints about unexpected temperature swings—either too cold or too hot for this time of year. Her camera, when photographing the sky, showed only unremarkable clouds; the lens failed to record what her eyes saw with such clarity.*

*She murmured to the sky, ""You're not as clever as you think,"" the rising steam from her coffee momentarily blurring her view of the perfectly hexagonal arrangement. ""Someone else is bound to notice, eventually.""*

*Like a living organism acknowledging her challenge, the cluster of hexagons pulsed once in response. Through neighboring formations, a brief glow sent ripples and subtle color shifts that defied weather system explanations.*

*Eden had seen strange things her entire life—flickers at the edge of reality, patterns where there should be none—but nothing this bold, this sustained. A change was subtly altering the careful balance that kept the world running.*

*Sometimes she wondered if she was seeing things as they truly were, beneath the curtain that everyone else accepted as the full scope of existence. What she didn't say aloud, what she barely acknowledged even to herself, was how sometimes the patterns seemed to recognize her in return, as if the cosmos itself was aware of her watching.*

**Timeline:**

I'm hoping for feedback within 6 weeks, though I'm flexible if you need a bit more time.

**Additional Info:**

* Complete manuscript at 79,512 words
* First book in a planned series
* Available in whatever format works best for you (Google Docs, Word doc, PDF, etc.)
* Looking for big-picture feedback rather than line edits

Out on the trail, she makes a rookie mistake and has to accept help from Seth, a rugged outdoorsman she meets. Their instant chemistry leads to a whirlwind romance over Rocky Mountain vistas and campfire light. When an unexpected wildlife encounter causes a rift between them, they must overcome their fears and past disappointments to find out if they are meant to be.

"[Complete] [47,500] [Children's Fantasy] Queendom of Phaer - Book 1: Believe","# 🌸 Beta Reader Wanted – UK Eyes on a Children’s Fantasy (1948-2000 England)

Hi all,

I’m an American author working on a children’s fantasy saga called *Queendom of Phaer*. The story begins in **England, 1948**, with a boy in short pants who encounters a fairy that heals him. It then cuts to 2000. The story starts as a simple children’s tale but grows into a saga for “children of all ages,” in the spirit of C.S. Lewis and classic British fantasy.

Because I’m not British, I want to make sure the **voice, idioms, and cultural details** feel authentic — especially dialogue for children and adults in post-war England. Think:

* Vocabulary (torch vs. flashlight, trousers vs. pants, sweets vs. candy)
* Period-accurate culture (rationing still around, shillings and pence, everyday tone)
* Making sure no obvious “Americanisms” sneak in

**What I’m Looking For**:

* A UK-based beta reader to give me honest notes on whether anything feels “off” or un-British.
* No need for heavy editing — just feedback on language, voice, and cultural fit.

**Length**: I’d like to start with Chapter One (*The Boy Who Saw Magic*), approx. 1,450 words.

**What You Get**:

* Early access to the manuscript
* Acknowledgement as a beta reader if the book is published.

If you’re interested, please DM me or comment below. I’d love to get some authentic UK eyes on this story before I push it further.

Thanks so much!

Based on some initial feedback I've reworked a few chapters and have added in a two new POV's and I am wanting to find some fresh eyes to look at the changes. 

**Story Blurb:** The FMC has grown up living a mundane life with dreams of far off worlds. One night a portal appears and she eagerly steps through it hoping to find her happily ever after. Instead, she finds herself in a human city that appears to be more of the same as her previous life, only in a new setting. As she becomes integrated in the city, she learns it holds dark secrets. As she embarks on a journey to find what is hidden beneath the surface, she also learns more about herself and her own past. 

It is a fantasy novel leaning towards dark fantasy with a side of romance (all closed door/implied).

* Mild Adult language
* Violence/Murder/Death
* Nightmares
* Anxiety
* Alcohol use

**Type of feedback I am looking for:** I would like to hear general feedback. I do have an editor that will looking over my story later this year. Until then, I would like to hear opinions on the overall story, pacing, if there are any plot holes I've missed, if the world feels believable, and how the characters come across. I've already had initial feedback and have added a couple chapters in that I would like to have fresh eyes look and to see if they work well or show too much behind the scenes information. 

**Preferred Timeline:** I am hoping to have initial feedback returned by the end of September, but that is flexible since the story will not be sent to my editor until later this year. At latest I would like feedback returned by the end of October so I have enough time to many any final revisions before sending it off to the editor.

"[Complete][96,000][Supernatural Psychological Suspense] PHOTOPHOBIA","I am seeking beta readers for my novel PHOTOPHOBIA. I have (unsuccessfully) been submitting it to agents for a while now. Finding myself at a roadblock, I am seeking a fresh slew of objective feedback, as my only critiques were long ago, few in number and came from loved ones. Although nowhere near experimental, my novel has some atypical aspects which make me fear for its promise in getting published. I primarily seek to have the question answered: is my novel hopeless for mainstream publishing or should I seek an indie publisher? Otherwise, I am seeking feedback on the big-picture as normal (rather than someone to hunt down spelling/grammar errors).

Here is the lengthiest version of the blurb that I have used before in querying agents:

Teenage recluse Rachael Vanity is missing. Rachael is notorious for one thing: she has a severe phobia about having her picture taken. Not a single photograph can be provided to the police; without one, nothing can be done to find her. Then an enigmatic figure—name and origin unknown—The Stranger, comes to Rachael’s hometown. The Stranger scours the town for the photographs of Rachael he knows exist but are being kept hidden. His goal is not for her to return home—it is to eradicate those photos for some purpose he won’t state.

As the hidden pictures are found and destroyed, most of the townspeople start to lose their memory of Rachael entirely. Her few loved ones descend into despair as they watch this unfold around them. The manipulative Stranger directs them in their suffering like chess pieces. He is convinced that his control is absolute. Then, when another teenage girl suddenly goes missing, he continuously finds himself humbled as his plot is flipped on its head.

If the Stranger fails to destroy all of the photographs, his cryptic objective will forever go unfulfilled, and Rachael will remain in limbo somewhere between found and unfound. The question lingers along the way which consistently remains unanswered: who is the Stranger, and what is his true objective? And at the end of the day, when all of a person has been forgotten, what does it truly mean to exist?

Trigger Warnings: graphic violence, blood/gore, sexual violence (not depicted), suicide (not depicted)

Will greatly appreciate any amount of help. For those interested in reading the entire project, I will swap manuscripts (depending on the genre though). It would also be greatly helpful for anyone just to read and critique the first 10 pages, as this is commonly requested by agents. Thank you. ",9,15,2025-09-07,dbo7734,90k,1.0

Here's an excerpt from Chapter 5 (""Sales""):

Many consultants are terrible at sales. They fear sales, or view sales as someone else’s problem. Sometimes, they even look down on sales as an unworthy profession altogether. They don’t understand the sales process and don’t want to understand the sales process. Consequently, they don’t speak up when they should, they don’t act when they should and fail to influence the sales process at all. Instead, they look at sales as a necessary evil. That colors every sales-related interaction they have with their peers, the sales team, their business partners and their customers.

Many simply don’t like sales at all.

Better consultants – the kind you want to be – are always sales-aware. Great consultants use this awareness to identify new opportunities, expand existing teams and extend projects.

If this makes you uncomfortable, don’t worry! Many consultants are sales averse and, in any event, we’re not telling you that the best consultants are salespeople. At least not in the common way people view it. However, the best consultants use their sales awareness to find new ways to deliver value. Value isn’t just the code you write, the business requirements document you present or an architecture diagram. It’s also about sales awareness.

You may be thinking to yourself, “meh, who cares? I don’t want to be salesperson. We have people to do that; “I just want to code or manage projects.” If you have that thought, you’re very much in the majority. After all, if you wanted to be in sales, you’d find a sales career. Know, however, that you’re also crippling your future growth opportunities. Like it or not, selling is the number one driver of consulting success.

This chapter explains the overall sales process – how it begins, how a given sale moves through a predictable set of “gates,” one to another until it transforms into a billable project. These activities start far in advance of a project’s kickoff, often months in advance.

We move on to talk about the different kinds of sellers you’ll work with, including commission-driven sales, inside sales, partner driven sales and the most consultant-relevant kind of selling – expansion and extension.

We’ll wrap up the chapter emphasizing your role in the sales process and how you can learn to embrace it for your own personal satisfaction and career progression.

Blurb:

Sixteen-year-old Helia Andreas thinks her cub shapeshifter ability is a little lackluster. Most of her peers have way cooler Astro abilities, why couldn’t she be like them? These are the thoughts that plague her when she’s suddenly plucked out of the crowd by a Sign superstar.

Nova Stern has 12 abilities and is a part of the eminent group called the Signs. The group is there to stop evil Astros from doing harm… or something like that.

Here’s a description of my book. 


Three women have spent 11 years perfecting the art of ""everything's great!"" while secretly wondering if anyone else’s lives feel like they're being held together with coffee, dry shampoo, and sheer determination. Amara has become the Pinterest-perfect mom who's quietly losing herself somewhere between organic snacks and color-coded schedules. Reese projects unshakeable confidence while hiding the fact that the untold truths of her past nearly broke her. Lainey is the sweet, accommodating friend who's been slowly suffocating in a life that looks good on paper but feels wrong in her bones.

They make an attempt to reconnect through a long overdue mom trip to Costa Rica. What starts as much-needed girl’s vacation, becomes an unexpected reckoning. Somewhere between the poolside laughs, and late-night conversations, the carefully constructed versions of themselves start to crack. Years of ""I'm fine"" crumble under the weight of what they've actually been carrying. they've all been drowning in different ways, just really quietly, while maintaining flawless appearances.

This is what happens when women finally stop performing their lives and start living them—embracing the ugly crying, uncomfortable truths, and the kind of friendship that can handle both your worst moments and your most unhinged 2AM thoughts. It's about learning that the strongest foundations aren't built on perfection, but on the courage to be authentically, unapologetically human with the people who matter most.

**Prologue**

""Come on, Babygirl. Breathe.""

His pleas grew more frantic, and even the flickering candlelight couldn’t hide the infant’s lips turning bluer by the second. Her small body lay lifeless on the old dusty table, despite the frantic pressure he had been applying to her chest for the past minutes.

""Arden... It's over."" The old lady’s voice was soft, barely audible in the silence thickening around them. ""Let her go.""

Arden pretended he hadn’t heard her, pretended the horrible truth she voiced hadn’t been clawing at him ever since she placed the frail, motionless body in his arms. He kept pressing on the tiny chest—pushing, releasing, pushing—over and over again.

It couldn’t end like this. He couldn’t lose both of them on the same day. The Old Gods could not be so cruel as to rip two beautiful, innocent souls from the world in a single merciless stroke. He would not allow it.

A hesitant hand lightly brushed his shoulder, and he abruptly turned to face the healer, his usually soft features constricted in a rage so white his jaws hurt.

""It is. Not. Over,"" he forced out through gritted teeth. ""Not until I said so."" The pity in her gaze was too much to bear. Arden turned away, resuming his hopeless effort to bring his daughter back. On the bed beside him, where he couldn’t dare to look, Leagh now lay forever still, her damp hair spilling in heavy curls around her serene face. He barely noticed the door’s weary creak, perhaps Alda going to fetch some help downstairs.

His own hands felt disproportionately large as he gently tilted the delicate head up. “Please, please. Come back. Please.” Tears were threatening to fall from his eyes, and he wiped them away in an angry swipe. “You can’t go yet, baby. You need to come back to me.” His heart clenched as he let despair take over for one everlasting second, everything in the room frozen around him, as if even the specks of dust floating in the air were suspended forever in the pale moonlight.

It was not supposed to go this way.

[In Progress] [66K] [Sci-Fi/Fantasy] The Pegasus Planet,"Hello there. I am mainly looking for some unrelated eyes to give this book in the making a glance or two. 



The Pegasus Planet"" is a mix between science fiction and fantasy. 



The Blurb:""A 13-year-old boy named Joshua from a war torn country gets separated from his mother and encounters a Pegasus that leads him to portal into another world. In said world a war had finally ended ten years ago. The ripples of said war can still be felt on each of the four planets of the star system. Joshua is asked to help in curing a deadly disease that has befallen the Pegasy, living on the planet Kitu. The Journey there will slowly reveal the strange history of this world and its inhabitants who are both Human and Pegasus.



Style and Tone: Written in first person.  A protagonist who is riddled with anxiety, insecurity but also determination due to circumstances . A clear anti war sentiment is ever present. Death as a concept to emotionally work through.  Another theme is working through the aftermath of a devastating event such as a war and trying to find unity again after a long time of animosity, 

Quite often meditative in nature it does get exciting from time to time. Casual conversations between characters are some of my favourite things to write, so there are quite a few of those. Also the main characters anxiety driven day dreams are the most graphic elements but remain mostly abstract and not too detailed.



I would be looking for:

\-General impressions   
\-Pacing and Structure  
\- Maybe also scouting out Character inconsistencies if they are too glaring   
(Side note: I did run my finished chapters through spell check BUT there may still be the occasional typo lurking about. )

  
To get potential Beta readers interested, here is the first chapter:



Chapter 1: Quiet.



My mother was shaking.

She was obviously trying to keep her breath calm.

Her hand was covering my mouth even though the last thing I wanted to do was make unnecessary noises. I was just as tense as her.

The light that bled through the floorboards above us wasn't disrupted, as there was no one inside the house.

Outside of the house, however, feet were marching. They were here. They were looking for town folk.

My mother knew how to fight, and to a lesser extent, so did I. But neither one of us could take on multiple enemies at once.

We had guns, but so did they. They didn't show any remorse when they shot, and they shot without hesitation.



I didn't know if I could actually fire a gun at another person, let alone with the intent to kill.

My mother had killed before, and she would do so again. She had taken lives in the name of the resistance.

My father had taken lives too. He was on the front lines after all. But me?

I was just a kid, maybe not a little kid anymore but far from an adult.



The voices outside were loud and erupted into the occasional fits of laughter.

Even a tiger can smile. I couldn't understand a word they were saying.

Slowly, but surely, their voices began to grow quieter until they were no longer audible.

The troops had passed, and my mother took her hand off of my mouth.



""Quick!"" Mother whispered in a hushed, urging voice as she pushed me towards the stairs that led out of the cellar.

I moved as quickly as I could, avoiding all kinds of things lying on the floor, barely visible due to the lack of light.

""Do you think they're gonna be gone for long enough?"" I asked, trying my best not to sound too anxious.

""I honestly don't know. But we can't stay here. If they pass the house once, it means they might do so again, and if they do so again, then they also might use this house as a shelter.""

My mother explained to me, still in a hushed voice, as she pushed me towards the stairs.

I looked up the staircase. Observing the door, I found myself in a twisted version of a memory from when I was younger.

I had been 5, maybe 6 years old, and my mom had sent me to fetch some milk from the cellar.

The door to the cellar, positioned at the lower end of a flight of stairs, stood in total darkness, inviting all sorts of horrible visions to creep out from within its void.

A child's imagination is endless, but in that endlessness there also lurks endless terror.

I just had to reach the light switch right next to the door, and the endless void would be gone.

Now, back in the present, I was met with a well-illuminated door. Light hitting it in a rectangular shape through loose wood paneling.

This time the terror didn't lurk inside the door but behind it. The entire outside world had terrors to offer, the terrors of war.

In my mind's eye, I could see a grinning enemy soldier grab me by the neck and ram my head against a wall until it was nothing but blood and brains.

In another vision, I was holding my dying mother in my arms as she was suffocating on her own blood.



I whimpered. I turned to my mother. Tears in my eyes. ""Please, let's just stay until it's dark."" My voice cracked.

""Joshua."" My mother looked me deep into the eyes and put her hand on my right cheek. ""We have to go now. They will probably set camp here when it gets dark.""

I knew she was right, but I didn't want it to be that way. 

Another vision passed through my mind as I saw myself holding my arms out like a brave superhero protecting the weak, shielding my mother from a fatal bullet.

My imagination couldn't fathom what that would feel like, and so my imagined heroe's death felt murky.

""I don't want to die, and I don't want you to die."" I whimpered as I felt another hot tear roll down my face. ""Joshua."" My mother said.

""What color is that wooden beam?"" She said and pointed upwards. 

My eyes followed her gesture.

""B-Brown."" I said.

""How many steps are on this staircase?"" She asked and gently turned my head towards the staircase.

I counted them.

""Thirteen."" I said, slowly beginning to feel my imagination lose its grip on me.

""Let's count them as you take them one step at a time."" She told me calmly with nearly infinite patience.

""O-Ok."" I responded, still choking back tears.

""One."" I put my right foot forward. An explosion could be heard in the far distance.

My head snapped upwards. ""Keep your eyes on what's directly in front of you."" My mother instructed, still sounding calm as ever.

I looked back down.

""Two."" 

""Three.""

""Four.""

""Five.""

""Six.""

""Seven.""



Another explosion, this time closer.

I looked up yet again. My mind gave me the image of my mother's corpse blown to bits; I started to hyperventilate.

""Eight."" My mother's voice intruded on my train of thought. Yet, I still didn't react.

""Eight Joshua. You are here, and I am here, and we are alive right now."" She told me, still remaining calm.

In turn, her voice helped me calm down again.

""Eight."" I whispered and took another step.

""Nine."" I and my mother now said together.

""Ten."" 

""Eleven.""

""Twelve."" 

""Thirteen.""



My mother now put her hand on my hand and our hands on the door handle.

""Turn it gently and slowly. No sudden movements."" She whispered to me.

We did. The door didn't creak. I somehow wished it did, though.

At least that way my mind's eye would have been more busy panicking about being discovered rather than imagining more horror scenarios.

We stepped onto the ground floor. The house was indeed still empty.

Another explosion could be heard in the far distance.

Now that I had opened the door and passed through it, my mind switched from imagining horrors of war to hypertension.

Every noise, be it ever so minor, we made made me stop breathing.

Even the rustling of tree leaves outside the house, which could be heard through the broken windows, was making me stop dead in my tracks.

""Joshua, keep moving."" My mother gently led me towards the door as we walked in a crouched position just in case a soldier was still nearby.

I was about to open yet another door, the door to the outside, when my mother grabbed my wrist with sudden force and yanked my hand off the handle.

She then pushed me down against the entrance hall wall underneath the draped window that normally would offer a look into the house for nosy postmen or other visitors waiting at the door.

At first I didn't understand, and I had almost considered protesting, but her hand had yet again covered my mouth.

Then I heard it. Sounding like a mosquito for a few seconds, drawing closer until it turned into the unmistakable roar of a motorcycle engine.

Multiple motorcycle engines. I held my breath.

Logically speaking, I could have kept breathing just as I had before, but my mind's terror had overwritten my capacity for reason.

My mother started stroking my hair. 

Maybe to soothe me, maybe to soothe herself.

Now the bikes were very close.

If they stopped now. I thought to myself. We would be dead.

The roaring drew closer and closer untill...

It began to fade away again.



Another solid minute went by before I started breathing again.

My mother stopped stroking my hair and removed her hand from my mouth.

""Ok."" She said quietly.

""I'll take a look out of the window."" She explained. ""If the coast is clear, I will start running towards the forest."" 

""Once I've reached the cornfield you will follow me."" She instructed.

I nodded.

""You will run, right?"" Mother asked me as she looked deep into my eyes, trying to detect signs of hesitation.

All she could see was terror.

Terror that, she knew, would work for my legs like spurs for a horse.

I nodded again. ""Good."" She said. I knew why she was running first.

If a sniper was nearby, then she would be dead, but at least I had some semblence of a chance to make it in some other way.

She opened the door carefully. No one was outside. At least no one that we could see.

""Follow me once I am at the cornfield."" She reiterated.

I glanced out of the door. I could see the border of the cornfield.

Crops gently swaying in the breeze. A promise of safety. Not for long, of course.

I remembered how I had played hide and seek in a cornfield just like that one, with a neighbor's kid when I was ten.

I had no idea if he was still alive.

Then my mother ran towards the cornfield  like an athlete runs towards a finish line.

I am looking for someone to review my WIP. This has been a project of mine for 4 years and its quite well polished, but no one has read it yet. I know its a bit long so I am looking for help in cutting another 5k or so.

  
Blurb (This is stylised for blurb, if you need a longer synopsis a la query, let me know)

Recently widowed, Adeline is travelling back to England to settle her deceased husband’s affairs. Alone and destitute, it is likely she will be cast out onto the streets of nineteenth century England.

But the final voyage of the decrepit *SS Amatheia* harbours a manifest of strange and dangerous passengers. Aboard the ship are spies and philosophers, occultists and stowaways, phantoms, liars and murderers. Hidden among them are those determined to end a ceaseless war using any arcane and sinister practices necessary, and those determined to stop them.

Carelessly, something is brought aboard the *Amatheia* from the bottom of the ocean. Something best left buried beneath the waves, and soon the crew and passengers alike are left lost and wandering through endless corridors, tormented by impossible and alien dreams.

And perhaps only Adeline, hounded by her own past and unearthly visions might be the only one capable of venturing deep enough into the ships hallways to save any of the souls on board.

Looking for:

1. General impressions (is it something you enjoyed and feel is an actual book)

2. Logic, flow and structure (any plot holes I missed, anything that doesn't make sense on sentence level).

3. Help in cutting 5k+ more words.

[Complete] [99k] [Paranormal Reverse Harem Academy Romance] The Thornevale Legacy,"My whole life, I’ve known exactly who I am. Harlow Evans. Practically magic-less daughter of two ordinary witches. A good friend. A decent neighbor. A human college student. Survivor of a childhood fire that still haunts my dreams.

But when I wake in Council custody, they tell me none of that is true. My name isn’t Harlow Evans – it’s Harvenna Thornevale. My real parents are dead, murdered in the infamous Dreadnight Assault. And the people who raised me, who loved me? Terrorists who stole me and built my life on lies.

I don’t want to believe it. I can’t. But the Council has proof – DNA, records, everything. Now my so-called parents have vanished, and I’m thrust into a world I don’t belong to: a powerful grandfather I’ve never met, and an Academy that wants to eat me alive.

I have no magic. No allies. No rights. Just rumors, enemies, and Legacy students who think they own the witching world.

Maybe they do. But now I’m a Legacy too. And I’m not here to play their games.

 \--------------

This is the first book in a reverse harem series, meaning that the FMC does not have to choose between her love interests. It is a slow-burn, with the spice level being basically zero in the first book, though it will heat up considerably in the subsequent books. 

**FMMM+ | Themes of:** enemies-to-lovers, found family, a badass FMC, academy setting, witches.



This is my passion project. The FMC I’ve always wanted to see when reading RH romances. She’s real, she’s human, and she won’t forgive easily. Please note that things can’t and won’t move fast. If you’re looking for insta-love, this book is not for you. If you, instead, enjoy vivid worldbuilding, internal and external conflicts, and curveballs that throw everyone off balance, I hope you enjoy this one.

 

**Content warnings:**

Violence, kidnapping, captivity/restraint, bullying, parental betrayal, family death, childhood trauma, fire/burn references, terrorism/political violence, rumors/manipulations, psychological trauma, sexual assault (no rape).

 

**Writing style:** 

First-person POV of the FMC

First-person “interludes” by MMCs

Past-tense

 

**Rating:** 

Adult – though this novel has no NSFW scenes, the following novels will.

 

**Looking for:** 

Pacing, story readability, general feedback, and overall enjoyability. It is entirely self-edited, so if you catch a typo or two, I won’t say no either (though I’ve done my absolute best to ensure that there are as few of those as possible).

I’d love beta readers who are familiar with RH in an academy setting, but if you’d like to just see what the fuss is all about, you’re just as welcome.

 

**Timeline:** 

Not looking to pressure anyone, so please let me know your availability from the start. I’d like to start with three/four chapters and go from there, so nobody feels like they have to continue if the story just isn’t for them.

 

**Critique swap:** 

Happy to do that, though please be aware that I mostly read fantasy, paranormal romance, and reverse harem. Anything else, and my feedback may not be particularly helpful.",1,4,2025-09-06,Lynnication,90k,1.0
[Complete] [3.5k] [historical fiction] Tragedy of the Harbinger,"Hi,  I’m seeking beta readers or critique partners for something I feel really proud of, *The Tragedy of the Harbinger.*

Written as a letter from a dying governor to his emperor, the novel is inspired by Julius Caesar’s *Commentaries on the Gallic War* and the First Emperor of China’s Qin Shi Huang's quest for immortality. I wanted to create something that felt tactile and real, but in a completely fictional and mythical world.

The story follows Flaventius, an aging provincial governor, as he recounts his final campaign across a newly conquered continent. His mission is to find the legendary elixir of life for his ruler, Yorian.  Instead, he discovers landscapes full of miracles and horrors.

**Details:**

* Adult historical fantasy with mythical/legendary elements
* Epistolary frame (the entire novel is structured as the governor’s confession-letter)
* Worldbuilding rooted in Roman and Chinese imperial ambition, with a tactile, “lived-in” mythic realism
* Themes: mortality, empire, paranoia, human corruption of the sacred

**Sample:**  ""The locals claim to remember the origin of this evil. They speak of a village, long ago swallowed by the wood, massacred in a single, merciless night by a rival clan. The blood of that horrific slaughter seeped deep into the soil, and they say the land itself was cursed. Soon after, the dead began to whisper among the trees, their voices stitched into the bark.""

**What I’m looking for:**

* **Timeline:** Flexible. I’d love feedback within the next few days as I look to publish.
* **Granularity:** Broad feedback is most helpful (pacing, structure, whether the voice works for a full-length novel). If line edits or notes on prose jump out at you, I’ll gladly take them too.
* **Concerns:** Does the epistolary format stay engaging? Are the myths and descriptions immersive without dragging? Does the story resolve in a satisfying way, and does the letter feel like a complete journey rather than just lore-dumping?

I'm more than happy to swap with any other short stories!

[Complete] [103k] [Historical/Literary] Where the Scarecrow Stood,"Hello everybody,

I’m looking for beta readers for my completed novel, *Where the Scarecrow Stood*, a 103,000-word work of literary historical fiction. It's a WWII novel, but not what you'd expect.

Logline: A quiet, antiwar novel of duty, disillusionment, and the fragments men carry long after surrender.

Blurb: *Where the Scarecrow Stood* follows Haruki Kawamura, a petty officer in Japan’s Special Naval Landing Forces, through the collapse of the Pacific War. From the jungles of New Georgia to the decaying base at Rabaul, the ridgelines of Luzon, and ultimately Allied captivity, the novel traces his struggle to endure in a war that eats itself, leaving even its most faithful followers behind. The spare, vignette-like chapters explore family tensions, Japanese ritual and tradition, and the fragments of identity carried home long after surrender.

**Style & Tone:** Character-driven, quiet, and psychologically focused. Similar to O'Brien's *The Things They Carried* or Doerr's *The Narrow Road to the Deep North*.Though antiwar at its core, *WTSS* is about more than the battlefield. The novel explores themes of duty and disillusionment: what remains when belief falters, and how memory reshapes survival. There are family tensions as Haruki struggles with the weight of expectation from his father and the diverging paths of his two brothers, each serving in different corners of the war. Japanese cultural elements — shrines, seasonal rituals, language, and objects like *omamori* and carved talismans — thread through the narrative, echoing what soldiers “carry” in memory as much as in their packs. Dreams of dead comrades and flashbacks of childhood and earlier events in China are interspersed throughout.

**Feedback I’d Especially Value:**

* How the vignette structure reads. Does it feel cohesive?
* Impressions on pacing, clarity, and emotional resonance.
* Character development.  Do you care about what happens to these men? Are you repelled by some?
* Reactions to the Japanese cultural elements. Do they feel authentic, overexplained, or underdeveloped?
* More on that. I’d be especially grateful if anyone familiar with Japanese culture (language, Shinto/Buddhist ritual, or history) could weigh in.

**Content Notes:** The novel depicts combat, starvation, an off-screen suicide, and captivity, though the prose avoids graphic gore.

I can share the manuscript in PDF, Word, or GDoc. I’m also open to swaps if you’ve got a project of your own. If 103k feels too long, I’d be glad to send/trade just the first three chapters and maybe go from there.

Thanks for reading, and I’d love to hear from anyone interested! Here's a poorly-formatted excerpt:

The Dead Road  
Upper Agno Ravines, 27 March 1945

Two mornings later, the fog curled low around the ravine. The squad huddled in a circle, knees drawn up, faces pale and gaunt. Haruki sat apart, eyes fixed on the ground. Tanaka picked at the bandage on his leg, jaw clenched. 

“Okada was a fool,” he grimaced. “Rushing in like that. This isn’t China. Any fool can see bayonet charges don’t work on Americans.”

Shinozaki tightened his belt. “No one told him that,” he said, eyes on the fog. “Or maybe he just didn’t care.”

“Three days of counterattacks,” Tanaka said. “And what did it buy us?” He spat, the sound swallowed by mist. “Nothing. Just more dead. We hit their flank, but it was like throwing ash at a furnace.”

Shinozaki’s jaw twitched. “They say Yamashita’s left Baguio. Slipped out with what’s left of the staff. They say Manila fell after the Americans shelled entire districts.”

Takeshi was silent. Tanaka’s mouth twisted. “So much for holding the passes.”

Haruki didn’t speak. Okada had vanished in fire. Hirajima simply hadn’t returned, though no one saw him fall. The fog blurred the outlines of the trees. Somewhere in the distance, a bird called once and fell silent.  

They set out mid-morning on patrol, outlines ghosted by fog, boots muted on damp gravel. The forest pressed close – roots buckling the narrow path, bamboo arching overhead like a cathedral of green. Haruki raised a hand. The patrol halted. Ahead, half-buried in vines and earth, sat a dugout. A collapsed trench ran parallel to the road, ringed with rotting timbers and sagging netting. No voices, no smoke, no footprints. He motioned Takeshi to cover the flank and crept forward. Inside, the shelter smelled of canvas, mildew, old blood. Two overturned mess tins, a rusted Type 99 with the bolt missing, a kerosene lantern cold beside a pair of woven sandals, their toes still pointed neatly toward the door. Haruki pulled back a torn oilcloth and found a waterlogged satchel. Inside, a notebook. The ink had run, but it was still legible in parts.

*February 11: Food gone again. Waiting on reply from company HQ. Corporal Sato went into town for rice, did not return.*  
*February 14: We heard voices in the trees. No movement since. Private Ikeda coughed blood again.*  
*February 18: Orders said to hold this road. But for whom?*

Haruki stopped reading. He slid the notebook into his pocket and stepped outside. He slid the notebook into his pocket and stepped outside. The trench bent sharply. There, under sagging netting, loomed a half buried tank hull, only the gun snout still jutting through. He brushed aside a veil of leaves and recognized the riveted plates of an old I-Go. The turret hatch yawned open, wires and fuses trailing into the cavity. Inside, shells were stacked like cordwood, casings slick with mildew. It wasn’t a tank anymore. It was a charge, waiting.

Haruki stepped back, throat dry, and let the net fall closed again. No fuel left — that was all this meant now. Steel turned into a bomb because it could no longer move. Behind him, Shinozaki coughed once.

“No fire here,” Haruki said. “Too exposed.”

They moved uphill fifty meters to a clearing just wide enough for three men and a cookpot. Haruki sparked a flame with pine bark and rubber. A battered tin bubbled with two handfuls of powdered rice. For a moment the resin hissed, crackling sharp like fat in a pan. It smelled sweet at first, then bitter — enough to turn his stomach. Haruki took out the notebook and stared at the last line — “*for whom?*” The ink had run, blurred to a shadow of words. He tore the page out, set a spark to it, and watched the curl of names and dates dissolve. 

*They held the road. But the road was already dead.*

By the time they returned, the fog had thinned. Haruki crouched in the gun pit and removed his webbing. Tanaka sat nearby, leg wrapped in a filthy bandage. His wound had stopped bleeding, but the skin was swollen and dark. 

A thin glow flickered through the fog, not far downslope. Around a smokeless fire sat men in coveralls, goggles and crash helmets pushed up on their foreheads. Their gauntlets and scuffed holsters were marked dark with oil. A few cradled rifles awkwardly, like tools borrowed at the last moment.

His own squad sat in patched uniforms, feet bound against blisters, while these men looked as if they had stepped out of central China. An officer stood a little apart in tall boots, a saber at his hip, hands folded behind his back.

No words passed between the fires. The clink of metal carried in the mist.

The corporal from three days ago trudged over to Tanaka and planted his boots wide.

“Where is it?” he snapped.

Tanaka didn’t answer.

“Your weapon,” the corporal said, louder. “Where is it?”

Haruki glanced to the side. Takeshi sat cross-legged, the borrowed Type 11 across his knees.

“I lent it to him,” Tanaka said.

The corporal’s boot landed on Tanaka’s bandaged leg. Tanaka flinched, teeth bared. Then he rounded on Takeshi, seized his collar, and dragged him upright. “You dropped it to carry him? Think rifles grow out of the dirt?”

Takeshi kept his eyes down. “I chose a man over a gun. Are we so desperate that I shouldn’t have?”

“Desperate?” he snarled. “You don’t know what desperate is.”

Takeshi’s voice came flat. “This is my third time being recalled to service. I’m not afraid of you.”

The corporal punched him in the stomach. Takeshi’s breath left him in a sharp grunt. He dropped to his knees, hands scraping mud.

“Not afraid?” the corporal said. “You will be.”

Takeshi gasped, one knee in the dirt. He tried to stand.

“Let him go,” Haruki said.

The corporal turned. “And who the hell are you?”

Haruki didn’t answer. The others were watching — Tanaka slumped against the tree, fists clenched. Shinozaki stood back, his gaze low. The corporal’s gaze drifted to the navy blue band wrapped around Haruki’s forest-green cap. A trace of uncertainty passed across his face, quick as a blink.

Takeshi, still hunched, rasped, “The man just needed to feel strong again.”

The corporal’s grip tightened. “What did you say?”

“If that’s all it takes,” Takeshi said, “maybe you’re the one who’s afraid.”

The corporal nearly swung again, but shoved him instead, sending him sprawling into the mud. “That rifle was, and is, the property of the Emperor,” the corporal said. “Its loss will be reported.” He turned and stalked off into the fog. Haruki let out a slow breath. Takeshi rolled onto his back, staring at the sky. 

Dusk came. The fire had gone cold. Somewhere downhill, water moved through stone, steady and indifferent. Haruki’s thoughts snagged on Okada, on the way his skin must have cracked in the heat, how the flames would have roared through his throat. The smell still lived in his jacket, though he’d tried to scrub it for hours. Takeshi shifted beside the dead coals. 

“He ran like he knew where he was going,” he said. 

Haruki didn’t need to ask who he meant. 

“Maybe he did,” Haruki said. 

Haruki looked past the trees, but there was no road; only gray, and the shape of men thinning into it. He thought of how Hirajima had stood like that, half-shadowed, always watching. Now the fog did the watching for him.

[Complete][96k][Contemporary with strong romantic elements] All the finest pieces,"Hello, I am looking for a few beta readers for my contemporary romance and very loose myth retelling. Manuscript will be ready next week (finalising the last edits), but I like to prepare by time

**Title**: All the finest pieces

**Genre**: Contemporary romance 

**Wordcount**: Around 96,000

**Pitch/Blurb**: Peleas Makris bumps into Thetis Thalanissos and her fierce eyes render him lovestruck. In the rushed exchange before she disappears in the crowd, he feels a spark like he hasn’t since his wife passed, leaving him with their beloved daughter. 

A rapid online-search and Peleas discovers Thetis lives in Athens. With the family’s business struggling, Peleas can’t take a vacation across the country. Luckily, the company just bought a villa to flip into a hotel there. Peleas volunteers to oversee the refurbishments. The first time he visits the property, Thetis stands at the gate. Peleas is ecstatic, until he learns she grew up in the villa and loathes it’ll be turned upside-down. Determined to woo her, Peleas proposes creating a new layout together.

Given the chance to monitor the works, she accepts. Laboring on the project brings them closer together. Still as Thetis warms up to Peleas, the threat of bankruptcy looms over him. The company demands the hotel ready and soon. If it fails, Peleas won’t be able to provide for his daughter.  He must find a compromise between Thetis’s desire to keep the villa unchanged and the adjustments required to make it guests-material—and quickly, before both the business and what he built with Thetis crumble.

**Content warnings**: Mention of past grief; mention of doxing and hate on social media; presence of a couple open-door, not very descriptive scene (I'd say 2/5 on the spice scale); mention of verbally abusive and neglecting parents

**Excerpt**: 

Peleas doesn’t remember having downloaded all these dating apps or even the last time he opened any of them. He deletes the last with a sigh of relief. 

 One less notification to worry about. Between work emails and Polydora’s updates, his phone has been buzzing non-stop the past hour. Maybe buying his daughter her own hasn’t been his best idea.

As if he could ever miss her ballet exam.

Another chirping notification and his coffee cup shakes , spilling black spots onto the review he should write about the villa the family hotel company has acquired the past month. On the screen flashes the preview of a “As per my last…” email he deletes without reading. He’ll talk about whatever with his brother Telamon or Katerina-from-Financial Control face to face.

**Preferred timeline**: By end October would be preferable

**Type of feedback wanted**: Anything you'd be comfortable providing. I already did a swap with a critique partner, so I'm more looking for the point of view of a reader. Of course, if you wish to go more in depth, that's very welcomed. 

I'm not looking for line edits, with the caveat I'm ESL, so if you maybe notice a typo/a sentence that doesn't flow well and wants to point it out, that's welcomed, but not required  


**Willing to swap**: I don't have the bandwidth right now to do a in depth critique swap (I already have a couple project to finish). However, I'm  a quite fast reader, so I'm happy to read your MS and provide general feedback the way I'd do with a book I read for fun.

"[Complete] [120,000] [Sci-Fi Horror] Quantum Fracture — Scientists test a quantum processor and unleash a reality-bending entity","Hi everyone,

I’m looking for beta readers for my completed sci-fi horror novel, **Quantum Fracture** (≈120,000 words). It’s a finished draft that I’ve polished, and I’d love some fresh eyes before I move toward publishing.

# About the Book

*Quantum Fracture* blends hard science fiction with psychological horror and cosmic dread. It follows a team of scientists at the Aquila Research Institute as they test a quantum processor that bends reality itself. Their experiments crack open spacetime, allowing something alien — something malignant — to bleed through.

As anomalies escalate, reflections step out of walls, time fractures, and entire corridors stretch into infinity. At the heart of it all is a question of survival, guilt, and what lurks between realities when human ambition goes too far.

**Tone/Comparisons:** Think *Event Horizon*, *Arrival*, and *Annihilation* blended together.

# 📖 Excerpt from Quantum Fracture

The hallway stretched longer than it had any right to. Titanium walls gleamed like mirrors, but the reflections weren’t right—angles too sharp, light bending where no light source existed. Elara’s HUD flickered in her vision.

STABILITY: 52%  
VARIANCE: 0.005%

“Hallway’s gone endless,” she said into the comm, her voice trembling despite her effort to steady it. “Anchors are straining—entity’s here.”

Something whispered her name—“…Elara…”—wet and guttural, not from her headset but from the air itself. She spun, breath ragged. In the reflection, she saw herself step out of the wall. Not a mirror image—a hollow-eyed thing in her suit, its skin sagging like it had been peeled away and stitched back wrong.

Her own voice echoed back at her through its slack mouth, distorted and broken: “…Elara…”",3,4,2025-09-05,Mp40bloodhound,>100k,0.81

While I would appreciate you letting me know where those are located, that is not my main priority, what I’m looking for is if the book’s writing is good, if emotional scenes hit hard and if not how I could do so, and most importantly if the characters work. 

Blurb: Love passes and changes in seasons,  and in a year Alin would come to understand that. Alin is a normal boy, and like most boys his age, he has a crush, a girl named Winter. Although he hadn’t talked to her yet, Alin was already head over heels for her. When she agrees to hang out with him after school after a faithful encounter in the library, he thinks his world will change. And it very much did. Although everything started smoothly and promising, soon their relationship became plagued with secrets, trauma bonding, and eventually murder. As the year slowly unravels, the boy’s innocence morphs into a twisted tenderness that would push him to his darkest.

Content Warning: Gore, abuse, drug use, emotional manipulation, and suicide.

[Complete] [28k] [Philosophical Fiction] Life and Death of Evan Applebaum (but mostly death),"**TRIGGER WARNING: This novella contains heavy themes of suicide and depression. If these could be triggering or distressing to you, it is strongly advised to avoid it.**

Hi, this is my first novella ever. Between writer's block, difficult themes and being a passion project this took me over 10 years to finish, but it's finally done!

This novella blends surrealism and absurdism, following an average man’s passage through a world stripped of meaning. It’s a meditation on grief, isolation, and coping mechanisms. While not the same as any of these, readers may find some similarities to authors such as Palahniuk, Vonnegut, or Kafka.

**Blurb:**

The only thing preventing Evan Applebaum from killing himself was a nice, hot shower… or so he thought. This wasn’t the end he sought, but a beginning he didn’t ask for. How did he survive his suicide attempt? And why? More importantly, how the hell could he get out of that coffin?

Armed only with dark humor and relentless reflection, Evan stumbles through an absurd journey that seems specifically designed to mock him. Worst of all, his traitorous brain won’t let him enjoy a damned thing.

The world has stopped spinning, and the only person left to argue with is himself. And even then, he loses to his own shadow.

**Excerpt:**

The only thing worse than a suicide attempt is to survive it. For the perpetrator at least, because the people around will not hesitate to express how glad they are that he or she failed. It's a bizarre situation where people actually promote and celebrate failure. Figure that. For the one who attempted the suicide it is a different story: There is no joy whatsoever, you just know you are so incompetent that you didn't even manage to kill yourself. The depression gets doubled or tripled – if that’s possible – and you are left feeling worse than when you started. Useless and helpless. Or worse yet, you feel actively like a burden, actively detrimental to everybody else.

When one is truly depressed, it is impossible to think logically or positively. Your own brain betrays you, sending you towards your own destruction. Where neither facts nor unconditional love can replenish your vitality. This is important to address, because the opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality. Someone who is depressed is not just *‘sad’*, they are physically incapable of getting out of bed. It’s not that they don’t have the will. They do not have the strength itself, the vitality. And so they see no release other than death itself.

**Other things**:  
Not really looking for anything specific, mostly what people think and any areas where I can improve. No timeframe. I'm open to do a critique swap but no promises on timeframes, just that I'll get it done.",2,6,2025-09-04,chernadraw,Novella,1.0

Hi all

First time seeking beta readers, so go easy on me! Or don’t, I need all the criticism I can get on my manuscript.

First of, ideally I would prefer British beta readers, but not preferred. English as a native language though please.

Divided Kingdom - Fallout New Vegas set in near future Britain

Genre - Dystopian Sci-Fi, but been told it could also fit YA Sci-Fi or YA Dystopian, so any feedback on genre would be helpful too please.

Info: I spent a year writing this, not a huge amount of time, however, this book was a recurring dream of mine from my childhood. I’m now closing in on 30. The dream always repeated itself for years into my adulthood. Very Fallout Inspired.

Trigger warnings: 
Death

Feedback Needed: Everything! 

I’ll send the whole manuscript, month deadline ideally, can be extended

Synopsis:

The Randor family live in a bunker in rural North Yorkshire, following a nuclear apocalypse in 2020. 

Dad Jarrod, Tokio, 18 and Nevada 17, leave one day in 2034 to gather supplies. Only to return their bunker burnt out and mum Jane is missing, leaving only a note behind. 

‘Pleasure Island’

Jarrod and his kids set off on a journey to find Pleasure Island and rescue Jane. Along the way they learn what’s happened to Britain. Counties are now divided by Zones and controlled by the Zone Keepers. They also find one of Jarrod’s life long friends, Danny, who tags along for the ride, and knows more about the Zone Keepers operations and experiments. Danny also knows about ‘The Boss’ who leads the Zone Keepers.

Drones, cameras, military style checkpoints and patrols, all stand in their way, but nothing will stop the family reuniting with their mum, and facing an old enemy from Jarrods past.

"[In progress] [78098] [A chaotic blend of dark comedy, psychological horror, action sci-fi, and meta-fiction] [Nonpaid beta readers] ""One. Vol: Me"".","Genre:
A chaotic blend of dark comedy, psychological horror, action sci-fi, and meta-fiction.
Think: Deadpool meets John Wick, written inside a Silent Hill fever dream, narrated by someone who knows he’s in a book and won’t shut up about it.

This isn’t a tidy hero’s journey—it’s a broken mirror. ""One. Vol: Me"" follows Ruth, a scarred survivor whose fractured mind gave birth to “One,” a fourth-wall-breaking, pop-culture-spewing menace who turns trauma into a weapon. Expect unreliable narration, brutal action, and comedy so dark it makes you wonder if you should be laughing—or slowly hitting that x in the top corner second guessing your options. If you like your stories messy, meta, and dripping with both blood and sarcasm, this might be your flavor of chaos.


Length: ~78,000 words (first book in a planned series).

Status: Complete draft with partial edits, now looking for outside eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Big picture feedback: pacing, tone, clarity, and whether the comedy/horror/action balance lands.

Reader experience: does the broken timeline style work, or does it lose you?

Character reactions: especially your thoughts on the main protagonist.

(Optional) Line-level notes if you’re the type who loves pointing out wording quirks.


What you’ll get:

**Blurb:**

>Kae Lambros's life was derailed when nightmare-induced insomnia thwarted her medical school ambitions. Fighting for her life and teetering on the edge of psychosis, Kae receives a visit from an angel. A *real* angel. Not only does Malak claim the world is ending—just as she'd dreamed—but she's also prophesied to help the angels fight in Armageddon.

>While Kae doesn't want to believe him initially, with her sleep restored and mounting evidence of the supernatural, she reluctantly agrees to her role as the Key to the Abyss. It's not the altruistic path she'd envisioned, but if she can save her friends and family from suffering in the apocalypse, it'll have to suffice. However, Kae quickly learns that the Abyss is a nightmare of its own. Stuck in a city of monster-like locusts as she trains to control her unique powers, Kae’s only real company becomes the Abyss’s archangel king: the brooding, yet alluring, Abaddon the Destroyer.

>Meanwhile, a battle between two societies of angels has been building for over two thousand years. While the righteous Elohim were watching over mankind from their golden city, the Adonai were suffering in a fiery punishment for their creation of the human angel-hybrid Nephilim. But with their release starting the clock of the Judgement Day, the line between good and evil becomes blurred, and Kae is trapped squarely in the middle. To survive, she’ll have to outwit the immortals—including one who wants to sink his claws into her so deeply, she’ll never be free again.

[Complete][52k][Dystopian YA] Violation of Intellectual Dominion,"Hello everyone! 
I’m looking for a beta reader that can critique and provide feedback on my novel V.O.I.D! It’s been looked through but I need more eyes on it to make sure it’s ready for publication.

Short description: It’s a dystopia where theres a regression pact so they ban everything about the past like books and even the english language and the government is hoarding all the good tech… the main characters parents were taken for having a secret library so they’re trying to get them back. The different main characters are fleshed out, though, and theres some interesting subplots as well!

Blurb: 

Once you know the truth, silence is no longer an option.

Lyra only wanted a normal life and to keep her little brother, Ryan, safe. But when their home is destroyed and their parents vanish, survival thrusts them into a world where silence is law…and questions are deadly.

The public believes history ended with the Reset. Books, art, and even entire languages disappeared. Yet no one dared to ask why. After over 150 years since the Reset, this became the new norm. But Lyra knows the truth. By accident, she uncovered forbidden documents with two mysterious strangers—Jude and Nyx—proof of the Regression Pact, the secret accord that erased the past and rewrote the future.

Every choice pulls Lyra deeper into a web of secrets, rebellion, and inevitable sacrifice. Protecting Ryan means keeping the truth buried… but what if remembering is the only way to get their parents back?

[Complete] [320K] [Fantasy/Adventure] Everlast: Beginning of the End,"Hello! I am looking for a couple beta readers. I submitted here almost two years ago and the people I did swaps with then were a huge help. Since then I've put my work through several revisions and am now ready for a new round. The word count is huge, I know (\^\^'). I don't expect anyone to read more of my work than what they give to me in a swap, don't worry. If you want to swap with me, hit me with a comment or DM. :D

I am looking for someone to give me feedback on my language. I am not a native English speaker and even though I've done my best and used spell checks and other resources I still do mistakes. If you could point out repeated mistakes, big or small, that would be a huge help. Beyond that any feedback on the flow of the story, characters, anything general is appreciated. Especially where to trim the fat. I believe it's still possible for me to trim the word count below 300k if I really try.

What to expect from my story? It's a character driven, slow burn fantasy adventure with themes of kinship, family, questions whether life can be predetermined and overcoming hatred. There's some sprinkling of mystery here and there too as this is to be the introductory book for more to come. The important bit is to just make sure this one can stand on its own.

There aren't any real notable content warnings, I think. Violence and couple instances of nudity, that's about it.

Blurb:

Is there such thing as fate? Is there such thing as coincidence? Are the two even different? What would compel strangers in a strange land share a common road? An easterner on a journey across the world in search of someone or something, bottling up everything inside. A man like a mountain both in size and in optimism, seemingly with no horizons to chase. A girl, a demon, hell bent on searching certain someone who can validate her reason for even existing, yet with nothing to guide her with. And a fourth one, diminutive in size, colossus in presence. A single act of kindness can be the difference of tearing each other apart and a bond lasting beyond mortal lifespan.

[Complete][73.5K][Romance] Caught Off Guard,"Hi everyone! I have finished a full first draft of my book and have done as much as I can at this point.

Now, I would love for someone to put their eyes on it who hasn't been staring at the pages for as long as I have, and give me some external feedback.

Here is the basic premise of it:

""She ran once. He waited. But when he finds her again, will she have the courage to stay?

After a wrenching heartbreak and betrayal Aria has learned the hard way that love isn’t safe. Guarded and focused on rebuilding her life, the last thing she expects is to feel something real again… especially not with a stranger she meets during a normal night out with friends.

After his own heartbreak, Griffin isn’t looking for love either, but when a pretty blonde needs his help, he just can’t resist coming to the rescue. One night dancing with Aria is enough to leave him wanting more, and when she disappears without a trace, he refuses to give up. Weeks later, he finds her, and this time, he’s not letting her slip away so easily.

Between prank wars, late-night talks, and adventures, something begins to grow. But Griffin is still keeping secrets. And when a devastating revelation links their pasts in ways neither saw coming, Aria’s instinct is to run. Again.

And this time, it means losing something real.

*Caught Off Guard* is a heartfelt romance full of slow-burn chemistry, flirty banter, second chances, and the kind of love that dares you to heal—complete with just the right amount of steamy, open door moments to leave you blushing.""

Specifically, I’d love your thoughts on whether the story pulls you in, how the pacing feels, if the plot is clear and engaging, and whether the characters—especially Aria and Griffin—feel real, relatable, and emotionally compelling. Honest, constructive feedback is appreciated, especially around the romance, emotional beats, and anything that feels confusing or flat. No need to worry about grammar or typos (unless you feel overly strongly about it!)—just your reader experience!

Please let me know if you are interested! Thanks!

[Complete] [112K] [Dystopian/Thriller/Drama] Avery vs The Cain Complex,"Hi there! 💕 I'm in need of 1-3 beta readers for a rather genre-nonconventional book about sibling assassin rivalries. 

AVERY VS THE CAIN COMPLEX blends elements of domestic thriller (bad home life, toxic familial relationships, sibling rivalries) with a dystopian backdrop (assassins, cults and the like). I'm an aspiring indie author hoping to churn out one more near-perfect draft before my November release date.



***My goal for this beta-read is to finalize:***

* Character Motivations - Do they make sense? Are they reasonable? Who's worth your empathy?
* Worldbuilding - Specifically, the culture and vibe within the home. 90% of Book 1 takes place at a single location, so I'd love to confirm what is (or isn't) missing here.
* The Plot - To avoid giving away the plot, I'd love to narrow down the timeframe, intensity and rationale for the ""trials"" plot points. 
* Pacing - I know it starts off slow, but I'd appreciate honest recap on how the pacing felt throughout the entire book. Especially once the plot kicks in.
* And, generally, if this is a book you'd want to read. Shallow, I know, but I've only had my fiance's eyes on this draft and I worry there's no other audience for it haha



***B L U R B***

*His family wants him dead.*

*Avery Valdis hasn't done his father proud. When someone needs someone killed, they turn to the Valdis syndicate, but Avery's string of failed assassinations hasn't just tarnished his own name. It's damaged the reputation of the entire family. Father can tolerate that no longer.*

*Now hunted by his own siblings at Father's command, Avery is forced to fight back. But then he discovers a dark family secret that could destroy the syndicate. Does he dare bring down the entire clan? Or can he find a way to restore his honor before his brother and sister fulfill Father's command?*



***T R I G G E R    W A R N I N G S***

For this excerpt, there aren't any triggers besides mention of gore and injury.

But, over the course of the book, there are a number of pretty dark themes. Please see full list in the document. Spoiler alert: The book features !nce$t and ch!ld d3ath, among other things.

I need to do some expansion on the world building and characters, but the word count is already high. I don't know what to cut or expand upon at this point. I am concerned that it is too YA sounding. I think I've read it so many times that I can't look at it critically any more. Below is a blurb and a link to the Prologue and Chapter 1.

[In progress] [251] [Satire urban fantasy] The (Un)weird law,"Hello everybody, I just wanted to post the beginning of a short story that I am working on. I have written more, but that needs to go through revision. So this is only a little tid-bit of a larger story (satire about weird laws) about a man named Alexander Lucius who has a magical cow and everyday he takes her on walks through Prague. Suddenly one day a British policeman, named Sir Harry Harrison the Youngest, from the 1870s appears, who thinks he is still in London. He accidentally traveled back in time, when he discovered a time machine that has been delivered from Egypt by an archeologist to London. Now he is chasing our hero through the streets, because apparently walking your cow in the day is illegal in London. What do you think about the beginning and the summary I gave you? Im open to criticism. 

The beginning -  
Alexander Lucius calmly led his cow through the stone alleys of Prague, like it was a normal thing to do. And when I wrote cow, I literally meant a strong member of the Hereford cattle, a brown-white cow without horns, just so were clear. Her name was Lady Annie Premyslid Tudor Plantagenet and countless other royal surnames that would take up a whole page, so I'll just use the name Lady Annie. Lady Annie wasn't fat, just a little stocky and her fur was so soft that when someone stroked her it felt like their hand was dipping into the softest cloud in the blue sky. She had a bright pink bow tied around her neck. Just the way she liked it. And a bronze bell hung carelessly on the bow, which drew attention to her desired presence with every step. Her face had a strange but still welcoming smile of a cow, that is, if you can even imagine such a thing. Oh, and one more thing. Lady Annie was floating, I don't know why. She was just 2 centimeters above the ground. She didn't have wings or anything, she just simply floated. Most people didn't even notice it when they walked by her because she was incredibly good at pretending to walk on the sidewalk. However, people who walked closer noticed it right away. Unprecedented, they always said with amazement, and Lady Annie was enjoying all the attention immensely. As always.  
Unlike her, Alexander Lucius was more down-to-earth.

I’ve just finished the first draft of my fantasy novel *Land of Thorns* (about 100,000 words) and I’m looking for 2–3 beta readers who enjoy character-driven fantasy with political intrigue, romance, and plenty of action.

My Pitch:  
Princess Adriana of Yothala faces a deadly choice among suitors while her kingdom teeters on the edge of war. Meanwhile, Alexander, the son of a high priest, begins to question the faith he was raised in as he discovers his true talent for battle. Loyalties blur, friendships fracture, and love and duty collide as Yothala’s fate hangs in the balance.

What I’m Hoping to Learn:

* Did the pacing feel smooth, or were there parts that dragged/rushed?
* Were Adriana and Alexander’s arcs believable and engaging?
* Did the suitor competition add tension, or feel repetitive?
* Any scenes that confused you, or felt out of place?
* General thoughts on characters you loved (or couldn’t stand).

  
If you like stories in the vein of *Throne of Glass*, *Red Queen*, or *Game of Thrones* (but a bit more YA accessible), you’ll probably vibe with this.

  
I’m happy to swap chapters or full manuscripts if you’re working on something in a similar word count/genre. I take feedback seriously and give thorough notes in return.

DM me if you’re interested and I’ll send you the manuscript (Google Doc / Word / PDF).

Thanks in advance for helping me make *Land of Thorns* the best it can be!",4,10,2025-09-02,Realistic-Cup7958,>100k,1.0
[Complete] [90k] [Maritime Thriller] Silent Tide - Book 1 - A Callum Reid Thriller Series,"I am looking specifically for Beta readers from maritime backgrounds. Although I was in the merchant navy myself I transferred ashore many years ago and seek frank, honest feedback from people with more recent marine experience in order to catch niche errors. I would also welcome experienced thriller writers. I would prefer a 30 day turn around if possible. My critique swap availability is limited to Thriller genre.   
  
Here is a brief summary of the book to see if it maybe of interest.

Target Audience of book:

**Readers of literary suspense with procedural grit**—people who like tense, character-led stories grounded in real work and real places (seamanship, shipboard routine, tactical problem-solving), not gadget-led thrillers.

**Age:** 25–65, skewing to readers who enjoy moral complexity and understated emotion.

**Positioning:** “A literary maritime thriller”—lean, humane, and technically credible.

If interested please indicate:  
a) Turn around time

[Complete] [102k] [Historical Fiction] Infamia - Ancient Roman novel,"Hoping to find a beta reader for a novel I have been working on. It's about an epileptic youth in Ancient Rome who is sold into slavery to act as a seer for a mystery cult. 

Blurb: Apollo has just watched his world burn. With the city of Sinope in ash behind him and born without the strength to fight, he is shamefully led away across the sea to Republican Rome. After suffering a seizure at auction, he is purchased by the ruthlessly enigmatic Severus, who can trigger his seizures at will. Armed only with the esoteric knowledge of his mentor and aided by a fellow slave he silently loves, Apollo soon discovers the very condition that has plagued him holds the key to his survival.

What you’ll find:

Lilium has only ever known captivity. Stolen from her home and trapped in a house of horrors, she has survived where others were broken—though the cost is a heart scarred by fear and betrayal. When her prison is shattered by a crown prince, she is thrust into a kingdom at war, secrets bleed into every shadow, and the power awakening inside her may be her only chance to survive.

Coldor, crown prince and feared warlord, did not expect to find her—or the pull she awakens in him. Bound by honor and hardened by war, he stands as protector to his people and commander of his men, yet Lilium challenges him in ways no battlefield ever has. As enemies close in and betrayal festers within his court, Coldor must guard more than just his throne: he must guard the woman who has become the heart of his fight.

Together, they are drawn into a web of assassins, lies, and desire. In a world where every choice carries the weight of kingdoms, Lilium and Coldor must decide whether trust will save them—or destroy everything they’ve begun to build.",3,7,2025-09-01,Sophiesteacated,80k,0.81
"[Complete] [55,863] [Dystopian Science Fiction] The Never-Ender","Hello! I am a fairly new writer; this is the second manuscript I have completed. Honestly, I am not sure what to do with it, so I am looking for some unbiased eyes to give it a look.

**Blurb:**

**What if the power to heal yourself made you the most dangerous person in your city?**

Alex Tryker grew up in Utopia, a fractured city where the elites live underground in comfort while workers like him toil above ground with little reward. But Alex is a *Never-Ender*—one of the rare few who can heal themselves. Some call them prophets. The government calls them threats.

When President Hawkins discovers Alex’s secret, the regime moves to claim him. Now Alex must decide: give in to the government’s control, or fight to hold on to his freedom—knowing that either choice could change Utopia forever.

**Content warnings:**

A little bit of violence. Topics of religion and control are discussed. 

**Feedback:**

Looking for general feedback and reader reactions on the flow of the story, the characters, etc. Interested to know if the first few chapters have enough of a hook to keep you reading.

**Timeline:**

No strict deadline, but would be grateful for feedback within the next couple of weeks.

[Complete] [73K] [YA Fantasy] Echoes of the Lost World: The Hidden World,"I would describe this book to a friend as a fast-paced urban fantasy with a diverse and lovable cast. It's like if the found-family trope from *Six of Crows* met the magical world-building of *Percy Jackson*. The main theme is the importance of **found family** and finding your place and strength within a group. It's also about confronting self-doubt and accepting your true, messy, powerful self. The book beautifully shows that you don't have to be perfect to be a hero; you just have to be willing to show up for the people who believe in you.  
  
The goal is to provide honest, high-level feedback that reflects a typical reader's experience. The target audience is fans of magical realism who enjoy character-driven stories.

**Sample:**  
Prologue:The Girl Who Wasn’t Ready  
Ea’mara - Evening (537 AD) - Stonehenge

Stonehenge is burning. Unnatural light flickers with smoke and the ground trembles underfoot. I run, running as hard as my legs will carry me. Mud drags on the hem of my blue dress and my silver hair, once tightly braided, lashes at my face. With each breath, my throat is scraped raw.

I shouldn't be here… but I am. And that's the problem.

“Keep up, child!” Sir Pellinore shouts over his shoulder, his aura flaring as he drives his blade through a snarling beast at my left. His shield is cracked, and his eyes ringed in exhaustion. “Whatever you do, don't stop moving!”

I nod, though something scrabbles at my ribs. He still sees me as a child… and by Atlantean standards, I am. Just barely a novice mage. But I’ve lived through more lifetimes than he could ever fathom. I’ve studied more, seen more. None of it feels like enough now.

Smoke curls around us, viscous with ash and magic. Barghests howl between the stones, and gnomes skitter past with gobs of gore, screaming warnings too garbled to make out. The air thrums with untamed power… raw and restless.

Then I see her.

Vaedra. The Atlantean mage from Dene-mearc.

Here is what I am hoping for:

* Provide an overall impression of the manuscript. What are its greatest strengths and weaknesses?
* Was the protagonist's goal clear? Were they engaging and relatable? Why or why not?
* Did the characters' motivations make sense? Were their actions believable within the context of the story's world?
* Was there a clear character arc or meaningful change for the main character? Did any characters feel cliché or underdeveloped?
* Which character did you connect with most, and who did you care for the least? Why?
* Did the character relationships, including any romantic subplots, feel natural or forced?
* Did the opening hook and make you want to keep reading? If not, where did you lose interest?
* Were there any parts that felt too slow or too fast? Was the story easy to follow?
* Were there any confusing parts, inconsistencies, or plot holes that broke your suspension of disbelief?
* What was the most suspenseful or memorable moment? Were there any points where you felt tempted to skim ahead?
* Was the ending satisfying and emotionally fulfilling? Did it deliver on the promise of the book's beginning?
* Was the setting easy to visualize? Did the descriptions use a variety of sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch)?
* Did the world-building feel consistent and believable? Were the rules of the world clear?
* Did the setting create an engaging and immersive atmosphere for the story?
* Was the narrative voice consistent and engaging? Was the prose appropriate for the genre?
* Did the dialogue feel natural and unique to each character, or did characters sound too similar?
* Did you notice any overused words or phrases that stood out?
* Were there any sentences or paragraphs that were confusing or required you to re-read them?
* Did any parts of the book seem unnecessarily repetitive?
* How would someone describe this book to a friend? What other books, if any, does it remind them of?
* Based on the story, what is the main theme?",2,4,2025-09-01,DiskCautious,70k,1.0
"[Complete][14,000][Fantasy]The Dagger","Hello, guys. I've been working on a novelette for submission to magazines or competitions (I want to see where my writing is compared to others, and if it is worth it to pursue this hobby further).  I am looking mainly for general feedback about whether the story and characters work or not, but also some grammar tips or fixes if possible (English is my second language and even though I try, every time I run through the manuscript, I find some new issues).

**Blurp:** In the desert heat, a young elvish prince and archaeologist in training, Yordan, discovers a dagger that might hold the key to deciphering one of the ancient elvish languages and help Yordan gain respect within academic circles as well as the royal court.  
However, the dagger is an important cultural artefact for Freed Ones, a semi-nomadic nation of elves that guides and protects caravans or camps around the desert.

**Excerpt:** The day was nearing the end when the ceremony finished. The slowly cooling air was filled with laughter and clinking of clay cups against each other as the Desert Folk celebrated with Alhienda beneath one of the canopies. I stared at them from a distance. At that moment, Rakshiel patted me on the back and motioned to the tip of the cliff, where now stood a small, crude burial mound made out of sand and stones.

We walked towards it and sat down, each to a different side. For a while, we did not speak. I stared at the desert, painted fiery orange by the setting sun, and Rakshiel seemed to draw something into the sand. I peered over. His fingers left rune-like marks in the sand.  
“Just something that helps me think.” He grunted without even looking up. Then he took a fistful of sand into his hand. “Do you know why this land is so important to us?”  
I tried to think, but there was only one logical answer, vague as it was. “It is a place of great significance to the Desert Folk, I am guessing.”  
Rakshiel shot me a glance: “Do not belittle us with that name.” he threw the remaining sand and returned to drawing runes into the sand.  
I never understood “Some theories suggest it might be where we diverged, others say it is a point where elves entered the Akkas Desert. I have even heard some archaeologists saying things about the ancient capital or kings of the Dese….” Rakshiel glared at me. “Sorry, the Freed Ones.”  
He laughed. “ We have no need for rulers like yours and never have. But there is something your people may agree with our tales.” He paused. “This place… it is, or rather it might be the place where we began.” Rakshiel gestured to the canyon below us. Tents and houses making up the place occupied by our encampment looked like a child’s toys scattered across the narrow hallway. “When we discovered this site, our leaders deduced that this is the place, based on our folklore. So we decided to request help from your professors and help you cross the desert and survive here to unearth the secrets.”

**Preferred timeline**: I would like to have the story finished by the middle of September.

"[complete] [80,000] [contemporary romcom] Five Heartbreaks","Hi everyone, I have finally finished a draft of my contemporary romcom novel, Five Heartbreaks! 🎉 After a couple rounds of self-edits, I would now be very grateful for some feedback and am seeking a couple of beta readers.

The book is set in the UK and contains some UK-millennial-specific humour and references. It would be great to get some readers from the UK to see how this lands, but very happy to hear from beta readers from elsewhere for general feedback on the story too!

**Blurb:**

Chloe Clarke has just dumped her perfectly lovely boyfriend because of something a stranger told her in a nightclub toilet: you need five heartbreaks before you meet your soulmate. It’s ridiculous, obviously—but also the only thing that makes sense of the restless itch she’s been feeling.

As Chloe revisits her past breakups—first love Sam, bad idea Stevie, complicated Adam, and romantic fantasy Matteo—she starts to wonder what each heartbreak really taught her, and whether letting go of Connor was brave… or the biggest mistake of her life.

Warm, witty, and painfully relatable, Five Heartbreaks is a romcom about the lies we tell ourselves, the lessons love leaves behind, and the terrifying possibility that “the one” might be the person you’ve already lost.

**Content warnings:**

A little bit of spicy content, swearing.

**Feedback:**

Looking for general feedback and reader reactions on the flow of the story, the characters, the humour etc. Particularly interested to know if the first few chapters have enough of a hook to keep you reading.

**Timeline:**

No strict deadline, but would be grateful for feedback within the next couple of weeks.

**Swap availability:**

After multiple self-edits I recently finished my second novel, and I'd love some feedback or to have some beta readers. The book is a first person dual POV Romantasy involving Aztec Gods. For now, this novel is the begging of what I one day wish to be a series possibly titled the **Lords of Day**. 

**The following is an effort of a back of the book description:**

Bored and wanting more than the life of a collections officer Mia De Leon wonders everyday if this is all her life has to offer. That is until the hot, tan, tattooed man walks through the doors of the clinic bringing with him an entirely different world. One filled with Gods and monsters that seek to destroy her for a mistake made millennia ago. Is she strong enough to face the dangers that lay ahead or like many will she walk away from the promise of love and magic?

Ethan Itztli thought he'd never see his wife again but when he steps into a chiropractic office looking for relief the last thing he expects is to see his long dead wife roaming the halls. She'd once been a goddess of death and destruction hell bent on taking vengeance on those who'd murdered him. Could this woman be the same one he'd fallen in love with six thousand years ago? Or was this just another cruel trick of fate?

**Warnings:** At times this story can get dark. It touches on themes of torture, self-harm, slight gore when certain deaths are described, rape and suicide. I try my best to show each character as they face these things in a way that is not degrading or glorifying.

If you are interested, reply to this post. I can send over the prolog for those interested but wary to read the entire thing. But if you want to read the completed work, I can send the entire manuscript as a word document or PDF, possibly other ways.

[Complete] [55k] [Romantasy] Promised to the Evil Wizard King,"Hello all! I am looking for beta readers for the first volume of my romantasy trilogy. Please note that all three books are complete and are in the last stages of editing; so there is no worry about reading a first book and then never getting the sequel!

**Blurb**

>When Autumn was fifteen, her father went to war against the Wizard King, and lost. Her kingdom has suffered his anger ever since. Now she is twenty-five, and her mother has decided that she’s pretty enough – and expendable enough – to be sent as an offering to appease that anger. Her job should be simple: convince the king to marry her, and through that wedding broker a peace treaty that will put an end to a thousand years of recurring hostility between their kingdoms.

>But once she arrives in his castle, she quickly learns that king Eltanin is afflicted by a strange curse: he cannot have what he does not own. She is warned that in other to survive him, it will not be enough to marry him; she must also commit to being his, all the way down to her soul. She has two months to prove to him that she’s willing to make such a commitment. If he’s not convinced, then he will kill her before the magic of his curse can tear her apart.

>But how can Autumn commit herself to him, when she doesn’t know who he truly is, or what he wants? Determined to uncover his secrets, she scours his castle, steals his private journals, and joins the servant’s rumour mill, all while hoping that her natural tendencies towards being “a handful” – as her mother would put it – won’t land her into trouble.

>She also finds solace in the company of the handsome magical creature assigned to be her knight. But as they start growing closer, that companionship might turn out to be exactly the sort of trouble she was hoping to avoid… Can she truly belong to the Wizard King, if someone else has already stolen her heart? And furthermore, does she actually want to?

**Content warnings**

For the first book: explicit sexual content, a character remembering their first time when they were underage (and the other person was an adult), violence enacted by a figure of authority

For the full series: dub-con in the form of sexual coersion

**Type of feedback I am looking for**

Mostly general reader reactions. I want to know how certain elements hit, how some characters come across, what readers anticipate and what takes them by surprise, etc.

**Timeline**

I am getting the manuscript back from my copy editor in november; I would like to have some beta feedback by then as well, if at all possible.

Thank you very much for your attention! 

**EDIT**

I forgot to add: this book is a romantasy with an ""endgame"" which is a throuple. The first volume makes it appear as a love triangle, but it is not.

"[Complete] [134,000] [historical literary espionage] True Places"," **Seeking Beta Readers for My Novel,** ***True Places***

Hello everyone! I’m looking for a few thoughtful beta readers for my historical fiction novel *True Places* (134,000 words). In particular, I’d love help from anyone with knowledge of Japanese language or culture to check a handful of scenes where I’ve used Japanese dialogue and phrasing.

**About the book:**  
*True Places* is a work of historical literary espionage set in Washington, D.C. and New York during the interwar years (1926–1929). Inspired by the true story of the U.S. “Black Chamber” (the nation’s first codebreaking agency), the novel follows Claire Winslow, a young cryptographer who is recruited into a world of secrets, forgeries, and hidden authorship. As she uncovers coded messages and manipulations that could change the course of nations, Claire must navigate questions of truth, loyalty, and obsession—while trying to survive a conspiracy that may already have claimed her mentor’s life.

**Genre & style:**

Historical espionage with literary elements. Thematically, it’s in the vein of *The Alice Network* (Kate Quinn), *The Secrets We Kept* (Lara Prescott), and *All the Light We Cannot See* (Anthony Doerr), with a dash of *Moby-Dick*’s symbolism and obsession woven through

.If you enjoy historical fiction, cryptography, espionage intrigue, or stories about strong but conflicted protagonists facing moral ambiguity, this might be right up your alley! If you’re interested in being a beta reader, please comment below or message me. I’d especially appreciate readers who can spot-check my Japanese passages, but general feedback on pacing, clarity, and character engagement is also very welcome

Blurb: Clara has always been the perfect daughter—straight A’s, endless awards, and the pride of her parents’ dinner parties. But perfection comes with a price: loneliness, rules, and a life lived entirely in the margins of someone else’s expectations.

Then *they* crash into her world.

Ivy, wild and unapologetic, the kind of girl parents whisper about but friends secretly worship. She drags Clara into skipping classes, buying heels, and daring to want more than gold stars on a report card.

Ryan, brilliant and unpredictable, the guy who waltzes into class late—literally dancing—and somehow leaves everyone laughing. He’s lived on the razor edge between life and death, and it’s made him fearless, intoxicating, and impossible to ignore.

Torn between her heart, her parents, and the intoxicating pull of freedom, Clara’s carefully stacked life begins to unravel. Grades slip, secrets grow heavy, and passion blurs the lines of friendship and love. For the first time, Clara must choose not just who she wants—but *who she is*.

Perfect grades don’t prepare you for this kind of test.

[Complete] [140k] [Adult Action/Science Fantasy/Psychological Drama] Hellfire Blue,"Hi y'all! I've recently finished a book I've been working at since 2018. It explores complex family/interpersonal relationships, the cost of moral injury, and personal growth in the face of systems not designed to allow it. It's set in a beurocratic empire that exists on an exoplanet, 124 Earth years in the future, and is third person limited. 

The story follows a young woman named Ava trying to save her half sister from wrongful imprisonment, while struggling with feeling complicit in the state her surroundings are in and the way people close to her are changing. It has an ensemble of main characters, a heroes journey touch, and a ""last stand"" battle. 

Blurb: 

*The Jury counted its psalms in bodies and its blessings in fire; the Jubilee answered with songs for the dead.*

*Ava Ralland only wanted to save someone she loved. Instead, she stirred a war that could consume her family, perhaps her world, perhaps both.

[Complete] [105k] [memoir] [Too Nervous for Lunch],"I'm a retired gay journalist working on the second draft of my memoir. I'm interested in initially trading chapters for feedback, then swapping whole manuscripts if we work well together.

*Too Nervous for Lunch* begins with my childhood as a bullied Jewish boy in the Jim  
Crow South in a colorful family ruled by an alcoholic, borderline mother. From  
there, my life became a picaresque cross-country journey to outrun my childhood.

Lurednto New York by news of Stonewall at age eighteen, I was kidnapped by a  
notorious mobster who was later linked to a gruesome triple homicide. I was  
banished from the University of Virginia after an acid trip gone awry and  
eventually made my way to graduate school in Los Angeles, where I also worked  
as an escort and began my writing career. I lost my first partner to AIDS at  
the dawn of the epidemic, moved to Santa Fe, and finally wound up in Chicago,  
where I was a well-known gay journalist.

The story’s throughline is my lifelong battle with anxiety, shaped by trauma,  
bullying, and sexual shame. Framed from the perspective of myself now, as an  
old man, the book is narrated with candor and humor.

 Professionally,nI spent three decades writing and editing for newspapers and magazines, both  
mainstream and LGBTQ+. I hold an MA in English from the University of Southern  
California.

Too *Nervous for Lunch* may appeal to readers of books like *Running with Scissors*, *The Velvet Rage*, and other memoirs that grapple with queer identity, family dysfunction, and survival. While rooted in a particularntime and place, my story addresses universal themes and experiences.",2,4,2025-08-29,fourthact,>100k,1.0
[Complete] [89k] [Fantasy/Apocalyptic/Tragedy] Title: Echoism,"Hello! I am eagerly looking for a beta-reader for my novel. I have been working on this story since 2019, and finally got it written into finality over the past year. I’ve done excessive editing myself already, but still working on getting s final editor, so some polishing and formatting errors may still be present, but the full story is there and set in stone. 

Echoism is a fantastical tragedy that takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting based around northern Switzerland with a diverse cast of characters,
It takes a lot of inspiration from real-world history and European mythologies. Norse Paganism practices featured heavily in the magic-system, taken from my personal practice.
The main character is a young Swedish man who can’t seem to decide if he’s the answer to the world’s prayers, or someone they’d all pray to get rid of.

This is is the first installment in a series about magic, living in an apocalypse, and the lengths that people will go in the name of love.

* Opinions on engagement, curiosity level to read more, and overall enjoyment of the work.
* Character/setting design feedback

[Complete][145k][ Gritty Low Fantasy] The Prophet's Legacy (working title).,"Hello, everyone!

I'm looking for beta readers for my completed manuscript.  The setting is medieval low fantasy.

Blurb- Arvid, the youngest of his family, has latent prophetic powers which are beginning to awaken.  In a theocratic nation like Amendera, such powers are more curse than blessing. Especially when you're Dregger in Melgadria.  If that wasn't enough to deal with, Arvid and his adoptive family find themselves drawn in to a secret war between between agents of the Church, and a cult of heretics seeking to overthrow them.

Forced into a fight they never wanted, Arvid and Co. must fight for their survival, even if it might mean going against those who would normally be considered allies.

Right and wrong tend to lose meaning when your life and the lives of those you love are on the line.

Can they avoid becoming casualties in a war they never wanted?  Or is it Fate?


Themes: Loyalty, classism, theological and philosohical conflict, Fate and predestination, moral relativity, loss of innocence. 

Desired feedback:

-Is the story cohesive?  There are several POVs which change regularly.  Are you able to follow the story?

-Characters.  There are many characters of importance to the story.  Are they relatable? Do they stand apart as individuals? Are they written well (even  if you might not like them, personally)?

-Pacing.  I do a lot of world building and character work in the first part of the book, with the back 2/3 being more about letting the plot unfold.  My hope is that by that point, the readers understands the characters and their motivations, and I dont have to insert 2 pages of exposition mid-fight;  I can just let the story happen.


Disclaimer: I've made several passes over the manuscript, but im sure I've still missed some grammatical and spelling errors.  Im not overly worried about those at the moment, unless they render a sentence incomprehensible.


I realized a manuscript of this size is a commitment so I've added a link with the first chapter so you can see if you might be interested.  More chapters are available on request.

[In progress][868][historical romance] Title: Before the war came,"Hi! I'm a 15yo boy and I've recently been getting into writing and books and stuff. The book is abt a relationship between a boy and girl (both 15) and the social norms of 1937 Britain. It explores typical gender roles, societal norms, different class expectations ect and the everlasting effects of the Great War. This is the first half of my draft for the very first chapter. pls enjoy!

**Chapter 1: The Trip There**

*March 2nd 1937, the Williams family are in their Morris 8 car heading for their new home in Eastleach Turville. Mr Williams is driving and his wife Edith is sat in the front passenger seat. Their fifteen- year old son, Edward is sitting on the back bench.*

Edward stared longingly out the passenger window. The hum of the Morris 8’s engine slowly faded from his ears. Gentle rolling hills rose just above the horizon, just enough for its naturally beautiful grassy-green appearance caught his eye. He had never seen a landscape like this before, the trees, the hedges and the open fields. Far different from the dark, smoke-choked streets and the oppressive gloom of Manchester. 

“Are you quite alright dear? You've been quiet for most of the journey.” his mother asked, a concerned expression lay upon her face.

“Yes mother. Just taking in the surroundings, that's all” Edward said, his eyes still glued to the window.They drove past a dead rabbit, blood soaked its silky white fur into a sea of red. Edward’s eyes lingered on the rabbit, but beside him, his father’s forehead began to sweat. For him, it was not just a rabbit but a memory. It was the 18th July 1916, the screaming agony of men filled the air all whilst bullets zipped past. He looked at the Red Cross armband on his arm. Its white base gone, the red barely visible now. This was now replaced by the mud and dirt of the battlefield. He rushed over to a wounded soldier, but it was too late. He was already dying. Save me please! You have to! Don't leave… Then it was all quiet. 

“Why are you sweating so much father?” Edward asked politely. His eyes lay upon his father, trying to figure out why his father was acting so strange.

“Just a bit anxious, that's all son” his father replied, trying to maintain his calm composure and desperately wiping away the sweat off his brow with his shirt sleeve.

“But father..” Edward said, but was promptly interrupted by his mother who looked at her husband with a knowing look. She too was trying to remain calm but she clearly knew something about her husband that Edward hadn't found out about his father yet.

“You shouldn’t question your father like that Edward” His mother said bluntly” She isn't usually this stern Edward thought to himself, I better stop talking I don’t want to appear any more rude to mother or father.

Edward returned to looking out the window, he continued to ponder about his father. His thoughts were almost ominous. However, he quickly tried to distract himself. Fingers stroking the leather of the empty seat next to him.

He then rolled down the window by hand and then popped his head out of the window for a brief moment, letting the fresh country air fill his nostrils. The air around here feels different, not full of smoke and chimney dust Edward thought to himself. In a sense it actually almost helps to relax him. 

“Mother, Father where exactly are we moving too? You said it was in the countryside but you never actually told me the exact place” Edward pondered gently to his parents.

“Well darling, there is this picturesque village called Eastleach Turville it’s quite nice I assure you”. His mother said with a smile spread upon her lips. 

“You’re mother is right son, it is a nice place”. His father added, eyes still locked onto the road.

“Sounds like an ideal place then” Edward stated. His eyes now focused on the road ahead, though every so often out of the corner of his eye, he would notice his father’s left hand shake ever so slightly. His mother then placed a reassuring hand on his fathers shoulder, they both exchanged a small smile at each other. The car had now left the sanctuary of the grand trees and the nurturing forest, the tyres now humming as they hit the smooth open road ready to face whatever comes next.

“Aren’t those swans beautiful?” His mother said, her face warming with the sight of something so elegant.

“Yes Mother, they certainly are” Edward replied. His head turned back to the window, this time admiring their elegantly patterned bodies and the striking contrast of the differently coloured feathers that adorned it. Suddenly, the engine started to sputter, sounding as if someone were trying to force a large cough. The noise instantly struck Edward’s ears. For a split second, he worried someone had fallen seriously ill, but then he quickly realised the situation. Not yet defeated, the car strained forward, its four tyres scraping across the ground until it reached the edge of a nearby field.

“Damnit!, though I filled her tank up properly before we left” Edwards Father said. An angry but frustrated tone within his voice. 

“What are we going to do now dear?” Edwards' mother questioned. A slight frown upon her face.

“Don’t worry dear, I brought a spare can just in case” Her husband stated confidently. With that, Edward’s father popped the trunk and pulled out the spare can.

"[Complete] [20,528] [Poetry] Lacuna","Hello everyone. I'm very new to Reddit (just made an account a few minutes ago, haha). So if I make any mistakes, please tell me.

**To introduce myself:**

I'm an aspiring Malaysian author and recently completed a manuscript for a 205-page poetry book titled Lacuna. I've already had a friend beta read my work, but I'd like someone who's not local to my country to give me feedback on the flow of the story, because this book is meant for an international audience. This may be my first book in writing, but I've written a few poems for work and got a few poems published in a literary magazine before, and I have a passion for poetry.

**Here's a short text on what the book is about (TL;DR available below):**

""Lacuna is a novel in the form of poems exploring the emptiness of anguish and love, with the sea symbolising its metaphorical vastness. The work starts with the poetic monologues of a human who struggles to live, their life ‘saved’ by a siren lover. The point of view switches between the nameless human and siren throughout each chapter. Their genders are kept hidden to change the nuance of the story depending on the reader’s interpretation.

The human eventually finds themselves slowly drowning while contemplating their existence as their lungs are filled with saltwater. Despite being so full, they feel an emptiness grappling their body, threatening to take away what remains. They are torn between accepting their death and succumbing to the obsession of their lover or to reject them somehow, completely. The tables are turned eventually, and both discover the reality of their true natures.""

**TL;DR:** It's a novel in the form of poems about two nameless fictional characters, a siren and a human, who attempt to navigate the meaning of what it means to love. It deals with themes of obsession and such.

**Please note that there are some implications of cannibalism and suicidal ideation in my work.**

I'm looking for a beta reader who would be **willing to give constructive feedback on the vague plotline, and I am interested in the general reader reaction. I am also willing for us to swap poetry manuscripts, if you have one as well.**

**My preferred reading timeline:** I am waiting for my targeted publisher to reopen submissions next year, so I would be happy if you can give me feedback before the year 2025 ends.

  
**To give a general idea of my work**, here is a poem from the first chapter to gauge your interest (I formatted it in this way for the sake of this post, but in the manuscript it's gonna be line by line. Just saying):

*Limp feet pull me in a yellow haze, / Matchstick in hand for the reaping. / A bridge burnt to ash, its body curling, / Akin to a newborn on a soft cotton bed. / Lilac skin in flames for a better life, / Kissing its thumbs to leave / A mark of the present.*

*I melt by the shore, / My limbs akin to seafoam, / Here for the moment / As I sink deeper to taste the salt.*

*Empty bottle in hand,/ Fingers slipping, gripping tight. / I fling it to the sky, / Eyes glazed to hope meekly / For the cap to pop, / Gulping in the wind as the waves / Churn it away to another shore.*

*Your hands travel my back. / Hugging tight, wings to an angel. / Like the ocean in love with the moon. / The night tugs at the sun, / Hoping to be released.*

*My words dry up on my tongue. / The setting moon escaping my sight, / The bottle leaving me as the waves blow, / My hands blind to touch, / Absent of wind / To let me fly.*

Three years before the story begins, she was diagnosed. Because of how it affected her mom emotionally, she shut off many people with no context, including the most important people in her life: the Harts.

The Harts are a family who vacation in her small town in the mountains in a cabin, which they eventually purchased as a vacation home once Mrs. Hart and Phoebe's mom became close friends.

Three years later, present day, she is 18 and freshly graduated. But so is Mrs. Hart's son, her ex-best friend Theodore Hart, who has been accepted to college.

* Sexual violence/assault
* Strong language

Manhattan was on edge. Bodies kept turning up — no witnesses, no leads. Every victim carried the same stain on their record: sexual assault. The city called it justice. The media turned it into a trial. Women hailed the killer as a hero, an avenger, while the police were branded as failures. For the predators still walking free, each sunrise felt like their last. The autopsy reports told a brutal story — an axe swung with merciless precision, and not a single trace was left behind. The name spread through the streets like a curse: **The Lumberjack**.

Also, I'll be sharing the scenes here to save you the hurdle of opening other tabs and working around them. Keep in mind that these scenes are in the first draft, and that is why I'm seeking feedback!!!

Context Of The Book: In 1871 London, a family of Irish settlers wish to marry their daughters into the Aristocracy of London, the novel/novella (cause its not complete yet). 

Scene 1 Context: Nora's uncle tries to touch her inappropriately, to which she comes to seek revenge to:

Eamonn sat in the drawing room, a dim oil lamp burning quietly by his slow rocking chair. The windows were open, bringing in breezes of cold air.

He adjusted his spectacles roughly every minute, holding a book in one hand, concentrating on it. No bird hummed that night, no animal from the farm mumbled. Only the sound of his rocking chair could be heard.

The lamp cast undefined shadows, irregular and uneven shapes on the dull wallpaper. However, for a moment, the silhouette of a young woman appeared.

“Uncle?” a deep, accented voice said from the doorframe behind.

Eamonn looked back, stopping his rocking. The figure was hard to distinguish but familiar as it emerged from the darkness.

A maiden with brunette hair resting on her chest, with fringes framing her face, came forward. “Nora?” Eamonn said, not expecting her to speak to him anymore, especially of her own accord.

Nora slowly walked forward, one step at a time, refusing to make any noise, her slippers negligible against the floorboards beneath.

“Yes,” she said as she laid her hands on the rocking chair before him, tilting her head seductively. She traced her hands alluringly around the frame of the chair.

“What are you doing here, my girl?” Eamonn asked, unnerved by her posture. The lamp flickered more ominously. A soft smile formed on her lips as excitement crept up his spine.

“I’d be scared to rest with just an oil lamp in this room. Don’t you think the same?” Nora whispered near his ear.

His wrinkles were traced by the deep yellow of the lamp as he looked into her eyes. Nora’s cheekbones caught the light, capturing his attention.

“Do you want me to be scared?” Eamonn asked, taking off his waistcoat. “I’ll be scared if it’s for—”

But before he could finish, she gripped the legs of the chair and flipped it near the windows, sending his body crashing harshly onto the wooden floor.

“They’re all asleep upstairs,” Nora said as she stepped toward his injured body on the floor.

“What, what are you—” he stammered, but she knelt down by his chest and forcefully shoved the brooch into his mouth, closing it shut with her hand.

He mumbled inside his mouth and struggled to breathe as she pressed his throat vigorously. The metallic taste of the brooch filled his mouth, marking his gums with patches of blood. His teeth vibrated.

Warm tears flooded down his face, wetting his head and sinking into the floorboards beneath.

“*Do you see the devil?*” she said in a low tone. “I’ll be the last face you see.” Her expression was stoic.

He rasped and clawed at the floor, trying to scream desperately, as though the walls would save him. And there it was, the lamp now cast the shadows of Caroline ending George, an ending she thought well-deserved.

She rose and dragged his body across the haunting drawing room as the oil lamp engulfed the moment with a dreaded smell of oil. She placed his body firmly in the unlit fireplace, among the ashes. 

Nora dragged the iron screen in front of the hearth, concealing a story forever.

“Ashes hide your sin better than prayer,” she said before returning to her chamber.



✦✦✦

  
Scene 2 Context: Nora flees her home to find her sister and her sister's lover:

  
Walking while taking heavy steps in the muddy dirt after thunder, a lantern swinging from her hand and fringes constantly pinching her eyes, Nora was on her way through the tall grass of the sunset horizon. A soldier looking for home in a cruel world, she saw fireflies marching the sky, blinking as signals under the open world.

She held her skirt high and scanned the land for traces of two young lovers, thinking they’ve got the world at their feet but roamed alone in places no one knew.

She paced faster now as the sun hurried to set, running downhill to find her sister and that boy. She walked until she saw a figure with rusty red hair and a blue ribbon through a vast orchid field.

Nora heard a man close to stumbling on a fallen tree, like crossing a river. “Careful there!” she shouted, sighing deeply after she found her people.

Theodore flinched and stumbled, falling into the river abruptly as Vera chuckled. “That’s that, I guess,” he said after shaking his head as he rose from the water.

“Are you alright?” Nora asked, concerned if she harmed another person with her words.“Yup, just minor scratches on my palms,” he said, shrugging off the moment where he slipped from a fallen tree seconds ago. “Well, you can make out on the grass here, I won’t judge,” Nora said teasingly, feeling alive again, not being overshadowed by the long walls of her chamber.

Vera’s head turned towards Theodore involuntarily, painted with a downwards smile and red cheeks. Theodore just passed a wink, adding more to her surprise.

The three of them sat by the river. Theodore picked pebbles and threw them in the waters at a distance, the mere light illuminating his view.

“Why’d you come here, sister?” Vera asked softly, watching the ladybugs marching the lily pads in the river at her feet.“Mama sent me here, she asked us to stay in one of her earlier friend’s cottages. It’s not so far away,” she replied, moving herself as she spoke.

“Guess we don’t have to spend the night snuggling into each other to battle the cold,” Theodore said, side-eyeing Vera as he spoke.

 “Okay, stop now,” Vera said as she clashed her head on his shoulder with force, resting on it with a smile on her face.

She envied them a little, how the world seemed to bend into play around their steps, while hers always dragged heavier through the mud.

“Come on love birds,” Nora said, glancing back as she stood and dusted off her hands, then turned and walked with purpose towards the cottage.

“Let’s go, belle,” Theodore said awkwardly as he rose up and joined Nora.

“What?” Vera said, scrunching her expression, confused if he meant something in French, and laughed as she ran and clung onto his arm.

In her first year on the Professional Tennis Tour, she's reached 80th in the world and should be reveling in the fulfillment of her dreams.

Following a humiliating loss at the hands of her former best friend, Georgia retreats from tennis in search of clarity. Who is she when she steps off the court? It's a question she's never dared to answer. As she reconnects with her past and faces the unraveling of present life as she knows it, Georgia embarks on a tumultuous journey of self-discovery. With each step, she rebels against the rigid structure of her former life, forcing herself to confront the painful, often chaotic truth of who she is beyond the game.

[Complete] [84k] [Upmarket / Grounded speculative / Political thriller] THE FIRE BEHIND THEM,"Hi all,

I'm looking for beta readers for my fiction debut, an upmarket political thriller set in an alternate contemporary Europe, the first of a planned trilogy. I would appreciate feedback on character development (e.g., do the cast's ultimate decisions feel earned?) and plot complexity (e.g., is it too easy to get lost?), but honestly would just love some general overall reactions!

**Pitch line:** In *The Fire Behind Them*, contemporary Europe exists as a single nation after a shadowy group engineered the destruction of its former nation-states and the supranational order that replaced them. Now, decades later, one of their own is ready to expose everything. 

**Blurb:** Eighteen-year-old Cassius Beaumont and the Europa Alliance were born on the same day in 1992. Cassius long aspired to power in the Capital, but a lapse in concealing his sexuality costs him the internship meant to launch his career.

After graduation, a deflated Cassius and his fractured cohort set off on a lavish but lifeless island excursion. A parting gift from their mentor, Nikos, leads them to clues concealed in the estate that catalyze a cross-continental hunt for answers. Sold by Cassius as a much-needed distraction from interpersonal strife, the group sets off across Europa to uncover what Nikos has concealed. Privately, Cassius is convinced Nikos has hidden a golden ticket back to the political spotlight he seeks. But when buried feelings for classmate Andreas resurface, he faces an impossible choice between ambition and love. 

The group slowly pieces together the puzzle, facing increasingly-unsettling discoveries while also navigating a tangled web of longing, resentment, and hidden truths about themselves and the bonds that unite them.

[Complete] [64k] [Fantasy] Where Shadows Lurk and Lanterns Fade,"Hello! 

I've never done anything like this before, so bear with me if I don't give all the information you need. Anyways, I've been working on this book for a while now, and I'm looking for people to tell me their impressions of it and possibly beta-read the whole thing.

The book focuses on a small valley in the world of Drinovia, and although the valley thinks magic to be extinct, there are hints of it beginning to pop up all over the place. 

**Short blurb**: 

Derin Quimbly is a normal boy, except for one thing: he can see in the dark. No one in Rogsden knows why- at least that's what they say. But when Derin's mother receives a strange letter in the middle of the night, Derin realizes that something bigger is going on, and it's connected to his family. 

However, Derin's plans of saving his mother crumble when a boy in the woods is taken by a monstrous demon from the sky. With the help of magic long thought to be extinct, Derin and his sister Kya have to face an ancient sorceress and get to the bottom of the mysteries in the valley. Can they save the boy? Can they save their mother? And will they be able to stop Lyvaria, the evil witch who started this whole thing?

**What I'm looking for:**

I'm looking for a wide variety of feedback, basically anything from the larger plot structure to the prose style. If you're not sure about it, I can give the prologue and the first chapter to look over. Together, they're about 5000 words, and they should give you an idea of what you're getting into. Be warned, the prologue and the ending chapters contain a bit of horror imagery. I don't think it's anything too intense, but I wanted to include a warning at least.

**Critique swapping:**

I would be open to doing anything under \~80k words, but be warned, my feedback may not be all that valuable. I tend to be good at knowing whether or not I like something, but not very good at articulating why, so I can't guarantee that you'd get much out of me reading your work.",4,7,2025-08-25,Shadowcat996,60k,1.0
[In Progress] [9200] [Dark Fantasy/Horror] Chapters 1-4 of The Grafter,"**NSFW: Gore/Violence/Foul language**

Greetings lords and ladies!

Nervous and kinda desperate for feedback, I bring forth my current primary project: ""The Grafter"". I would be delighted if some of you would read these first four chapters and provide some much needed feedback, it would be greatly appreciated. 

**Feedback/critique requested:** Primarily prose, but also general impressions, story potential, characters, flow, content. Well ANY feedback you feel like giving is highly welcome. Don't hold back, be as harsh as need be, I can take it and it helps writers grow. But it would also be interesting to hear if I'm doing something right as well. 

\*\*\*

**Genre:** Dark Fantasy Horror Mystery with some dark humour.

\*\*\*

**Project:** The full project is called ""Maiyr's Madness and Mysteries"". It's an anthology/collection series of shorter stories. The stories are standalone stories with endings, but there's an overarching plot. Think a mix between Sherlock Holmes and The Witcher + Lovecraft, set in dark fantasy horror. ""The Grafter"" is the first story in that series. 

It'll be a trilogy of books. The two first volumes will be 4-7 shorter stories each (novelette/novella length). While the third book will be a full novel focusing only on the climax of the overarching plot.

There will be two types of stories: 1. ""Complex"" ones that are directly linked to the overarching main plot. 2. Standalone ones that are not linked, but will add some element for the main plot (Think character powerup or new main character ""party member"" as well as character development).

Each story will be a different flavour/sub-genre (or combo) of horror themes in a dark high fantasy setting.

**Goal:** I'm currently aiming at making this volume 1 my debut project. I do have a massive dark fantasy adventure story with a finished draft (and varying degrees of editing), which I consider my true main project. But it stands at 320k words in its current state (which will see some trimming, but there will also be more fleshing out some parts, so no idea where it could land) AND it's the first book in a saga series that'll be between 6-9 books probably. 

So it seems unlikely that any publisher would touch that huge project as my debut at least. Plus I'm trying to improve my prose and finding my proper author's voice, to give the main project the love and care it deserves. Hence why I've started like 8 smaller projects and think I've decided to focus primarily on this project. But we'll see if it can get well-received by test/beta/critique-readers. Maybe it turns out it doesn't have potential and that's where I need you fine people to give me a hunch of how it's going. 

Also, Maiyr's Madness and Mysteries takes place in the same world as that main project. Not really a spin-off, more like a standalone series in the same setting, taking place a few years before the events of the main project.

**Length:** I roughly estimate that The Grafter will be around 30k words. The other stories will probably be between 15k-40k words. The plan is to land volume 1 at between 100k-150k words. Probably the same for volume 2. While volume 3 will a be one story at novel length (so probably somewhere between 60k-150k words). 

\*\*\*

**Synopsis Main Project:** You follow special detective agent Keiran Maiyr who's a ""cryptica hunter"" (Think sort of a fantasy version of an SCP agent) and each story will be a different investigation case dealing with supernatural horror elements, while the third book will be more like a dark fantasy adventure.

Keiran does not just go up against supernatural and evil forces while solving mysteries, he must also face the ghosts and demons of his complex past (both literally and figuratively).

**Synopsis** **Story 1 - The Grafter:** After a rough awakening, Keiran finds himself quite crippled and disoriented in some unknown place. He desperately attempts to escape the horrifying madness within the stone walls that confine him. While facing gruesome discoveries, abominations and battling his own insanity.

The Grafter will primarily be Body Horror, but also bits of Psychological Horror, plus some Dark Humour.

\*\*\*

**Inspiration:** Re-animator movies, Evil Dead 2, Braindead and various fantasy stories.

\*\*\*

So yeah, any feedback is welcome (both positive and negative), thank you for your time! Here are chapters 1-4. Hope you enjoy it:

"[In Progress] [110,000] [Hecate-Inspired Adult Dark Romantasy] Witchfire at the Crossroads","Hi everyone,

I’m Sammie, a UK-born writer living in Sweden, currently drafting my debut novel *Witchfire at the Crossroads*, the first in a planned dark mythic romantasy series. I’m looking for beta readers who enjoy immersive, gothic-inspired fantasy with slow-burn romantasy elements, mythic twists, and morally complex villains.

**About the book:**  
*Witchfire at the Crossroads* (110k words) is an adult dark romantasy inspired by Hecate and Greek mythology, with an atmospheric, witchy aesthetic. It blends lush worldbuilding, an older heroine’s arc of belonging and survival, and a prophecy that threatens to unravel multiple realms.

**Blurb:**  
Enodia “Dia” Ashveil has always felt out of place. Haunted by recurring dreams of a forest crossroads and a faceless woman rimmed in torchlight, she wakes each morning with dirt beneath her nails and shadows that will not leave her. When her best friend is attacked by a corrupted magical creature, Dia fights back, unleashing raw power she never knew she had.

Dragged into the hidden world of witches, Dia discovers she is not just an affinity witch, but something rarer: an Eclectic, able to wield more than one type of magic. Whispers of an ancient prophecy suggest that one Eclectic will inherit crossroads magic and open the paths between worlds, but Dia is not the only one who might claim it. A Bone Witch, consumed by obsession, is hunting witches to drain their power and crown herself as prophecy’s heir.

Caught between mistrustful covens, dangerous alliances, and the pull of a divine goddess who is far from absent, Dia must decide whether to embrace the power she fears, or risk losing everyone she has left.

**Details:**

* Genre: Adult dark fantasy / romantasy
* Length: 20k out of 110,000 words
* POV: First person, present tense
* Tone: Atmospheric, gothic, witchy
* Themes: myth, prophecy, identity, survival, belonging, found family, slow-burn tension
* Romance: Slow-burn, no spice in Book 1 (potential in later books)

I’d love feedback on:

* Pacing and flow (does the story hold your attention?)
* Character development (Dia as a flawed, older FMC; villain complexity)
* Clarity of the magic system and worldbuilding
* Overall engagement and voice

I am aiming to finish my first draft in the next couple of weeks, I'm currently piecing all the parts together from my planning.

I'll really appreciate it if I could get maybe three readers here to help me out. I'll be eternally grateful. Here is the information below:

**Feedback I'm Looking For:**

As they bond over shared memories and navigate their budding feelings, they make a discovery neither was expecting: her father’s request for their marriage. 

Take a step back in time and join Rosalind and Alexander on a fascinating journey as they explore all that marriage has to offer…and take.

**📖 Summary:**

  
With a modern mindset trapped in a traditional world, will this young Brazilian woman discover a path to education, travel, and love?

In Brazil during the 2000s, Francesca Silva craved more. Born into a family struggling financially and bound by her father’s rigid evangelical beliefs, the smart dreamer longs for a brighter future. So, when fate delivers a handsome American missionary, the teen opens her heart and rebels against her traditional machismo culture.

More determined than ever to expand her mind, the naïve woman battles familial expectations amid eye-opening foreign customs. But with domestic drama, romantic complications, and a language barrier, the go-getter fears that more than a visa and an airplane flight will prevent her from claiming her true self.

I have plans to get it published, but I want to write all three novels before I begin submitting it again (I don't want to be cornered by deadlines in case I'm picked up).

***Type of Feedback***  
I'm pretty much done with the editing phase (as much as I want to be) so all I'm really looking for is:

* Reactions
* Opinions about the characters
* Speculation for what's going to happen next (before you read it)
* Clarity and if it all makes sense
* Your thoughts on the book's overall themes as you interpret them

***Content Warnings***  
Physical violence, one non-graphic torture scene, gaslighting and manipulation, mentions of suicide, one PG13 intimacy scene.

***Blurb***  
In the pillar city of Algiers, gods walk in the flesh. Some are beautiful. Some are terrible. All of them lie.

Lilith, an escaped acolyte from a remote desert village, comes as a refugee scarred by betrayal and newly free, but she finds this new city no more merciful than the cult she escaped. Rune, a grieving soldier, begins to question everything he ever knew as he realizes the city he once served is built on corruption. Lucifer, a principled statesman, grapples with his doubts and faults as he uncovers truths he was not prepared for.

And somewhere in the shadows lurks the Dreamer, a silent masked figure intent on murdering the gods themselves.

***Preferred Timeline***  
I'm not married to any particular timeline but we can discuss what's reasonable for you and your circumstances.

***Critique swap availability***  
I am willing to do this. I've had a bad experience of this in the past, where the other person wasn't closely reading my work and didn't offer a lot of commentary, and conversely demanded a lot from me. But I'm older and wiser and I will learn to trust again.

Blurb:

Sonya, the last sibling of the arch-angels, is crowned queen of a kingdom in heaven she never wanted. Yet it is her duty. Duty has always been the one thing leading her life. When war erupts in heaven, unleashed by her own brothers, she’s forced to embrace a life beyond duty. With the support of her loyal guard, Oliver, she faces the war head on while balancing a kingdom barely out of its infancy.

What I’m looking for:

I’m looking for feedback. Whether that’s my pacing, description, etc. I will accept all feedback! :) I also want to understand how my characters are coming across to others.

[Complete] [180k] [Crime Drama] [Lion Den +Crown Jewel],"Hello. I am requesting beta readers for my 2-book crime drama series. The books are titled ‘Lion Den’ and ‘Crown Jewel.’ I am looking for structural feedback, pacing, and character feedback. 

The books are about two characters who claw their way up through abuse and organized crime. Full content warnings come with each manuscript. 

The main things I’m looking for are:

Pacing-where do the chapters drag? Where do they seem too fast?

Characters-are my two main characters believable? Are their arcs compelling?

Pathos-where does it hit you in the emotions? Is there a good balance between bleakness and relief?

Format: I have two read-only PDFs (one for each book) and a feedback form that’s fillable that I can send via Dropbox. If anyone is interested in reading my stories, please DM me and I will go a little bit more into what they’re about and into the content warnings a little bit more. 

Timeline: 4-6 weeks, but I’m not picky. 

Asks: more on honest reactions and thoughts on structure. I want to see more if these stories resonate than looking for line edits. However, in the feedback form, there are areas to suggest line rewrites as well. 

Anyone who’s interested, just let me know and I’ll send you the links. 


Excerpt from Lion Den:

“
Emma looked around, scanning her surroundings. A dark, foreboding tree branch tickled her with its proximity, but she kept going, looking back in a panic every few seconds, avoiding the roots that threatened to trip her. With every step, she felt leaves kiss her with their wet tongues. She didn't care. As torn up as her clothing had been before, it certainly wouldn't be salvageable now, since the branches that cut her face with their merciless blades did even more to her clothes. 


She imagined how her mother would look at her with disapproval, sighing at the tatters her daughter was in. She kept on running. Occasionally she would hear voices shouting. As she heard a twig snap right behind her, she turned around, utter panic and terror flowing through her heart. 


 I'm dead. At least, if not now, I'll wish I was. The boy was young, he looked no older than sixteen. Subtly muscular, nervous, with a cold exterior. His confident demeanor was contradicted in his eyes, filled with misery. 


  He looked at the girl, his mark, and saw the same deer-in-the-headlights expression that he was sure he was wearing. Unsure, he stopped as she stumbled backward and tripped over a tree root. She scrambled away from him, holding together her tattered shirt. 



 ""Please, please! I'll do anything you want me to do, just don't kill me! Please don't tell your men that you found me!"" The girl was sobbing unabashedly. He looked at her black eye, and his face wrinkled, showing concern. Something in his curious eyes changed. They deepened, showing more empathy. 


 He lowered the gun he had pointed at her head. ""I'm gonna turn around for one minute. Head start, little lady. Better take it. I'll throw them off of your trail. Run."" 


 He watched her get up, and she backed away slowly. He turned around and heard the twigs snapping as she ran off. She figured that, if he was lying, there was no loss, but if he was telling the truth, he might've saved her life. 


Emma ended up on a familiar trail through the woods that took her within half a mile of her house. In her relatively safe neighborhood, she wouldn't have to worry about her torn clothing attracting too much unwanted attention. She knew no one would be out at this time of night. It's not like the clothes would attract much attention in this city, anyway. 
“

Excerpt from Crown Jewel:

“

In a dingy diner, I see a familiar face. My stomach drops, and my heart pounds. I pull into the restaurant's parking lot and observe.

Even though she's wearing a very unappealing shade of mustard yellow, Emma's still as beautiful as she is in my dreams. Her long hair is in a high bun. I see her laughing and joking with a customer, a carefree grin on her face. She seems happy.  

There's only one car parked in the lot, and I suspect that employee parking is in the rear. I'm sure I'd find the car I gifted Emma back there.

On a whim, I decided to pull into a spot near the front door, shut off my engine, and walk through the door. It's mid-morning on a workday, so the skeleton crew working seems to meander around. I smile at the hostess. She smiles back at me.

""Hi, welcome to TJs! How many for you?"" I look around me and bite back the smartass reply I'd usually give. I want to be cordial, in case Emma walks by. I don't see her, so she must've ducked into the back for something. I don't see any other waitresses around.

""Just me. I prefer a booth by the window."" The hostess, the nametag sewed to her mustard yellow dress reading ""JAN,"" grabs a menu and ushers me to a seat.

""Your server today will be Emma, I'm sure she'll be right out to greet you!"" I smile and thank her. I hold the fold-out, cheesy-looking menu, so it covers my face. I hear footsteps approach me and register the sound of a water glass being set down on the table.

""Hi, there! How are you doing today?"" The familiar throaty voice is like a knife twisting in my stomach. I drop the menu.

""Very well, beautiful. How are you?"" I register shock on Emma's face behind her frozen smile. She's obviously trying to keep her composure, and her customer service facade up. It slips a little, though. I see the disappointment in her green eyes as she drops them from my gaze, and I size her up.

She looks healthier than before. A small, but defined bump is visible around where her shirt meets her black skirt. Nonetheless, she's still the tiny firecracker I remember.

""Jewel. What do you want?"" Her flat tone doesn't surprise me, but it still hurts. I wish she'd go back to calling me my name instead of my hated street name.

""Um, I'll start with coffee first, and then I'll order some breakfast."" Emma nods curtly and turns on her heel, pivoting herself away from me.

I expected nothing less from her, but I'd hoped that she'd be at least a little happier to see me than that.

Well, hope in one hand, shit in the other.

I wait a while for my coffee. When Emma brings it, she sets it down in front of me in such a way that most of it sloshes out of the cup. I grab a handful of napkins from the dispenser next to me and start mopping up the spill.

""Oops. Well, at least there's plenty of room for cream and sugar now."" Her snarky tone penetrates me like a bullet.

•	Pacing (any slow or rushed parts?)

•	Characters (are Mara, Rafi, and crew engaging enough to carry the story?)

I'm new to this whole thing, this is my first book. 

The book is called Fortune and is set in 1992 Newfoundland shortly after the collapse of the cod fishery. It follows a group of fishermen that steal a shipment of drug money and inadvertently set off an international drug war with the small town of Fortune and a weary local RCMP officer caught in the middle. Fortune is a dark comedy/crime drama in the vein of the works of Elmore Leonard and Cormac McCarthy.

[In Progress][20k] [ Romance / Cross-cultures] Dil in Deutschland,"**Looking for Beta Readers!**

**About my book...**  
When a private video spreads online, my world flips overnight. In three hours, I go from anonymous student to headline scandal. By the sixth hour, the call comes from home — not Germany, but *home-home* in Hyderabad, where Amma mutters “Ayyo Bhagavan” and my father’s silence feels like fire.

This isn’t the life I planned when I left India four years ago with one suitcase and too many dreams. I didn’t expect to fall in love with someone my family could never accept. I didn’t expect to be judged, trolled, followed — all for daring to love outside their definition of “right.”

This book is my journey: from the wide-eyed girl stepping off a plane to the woman forced to choose between family, love, and her own voice.

If you love:

* Immigrant stories with heart and grit
* Romance tangled in cultural expectations
* Family drama, heartbreak, and resilience
* A confessional, cinematic writing style
* *Never Have I Ever* x *Normal People* vibes

Then consider beta reading my book. 🌏❤️

**How it will work:**

* I’ll send out the story in short segments (2–3 chapters at a time).
* **Timeline:** Each segment should be read within 3–5 days so I can keep feedback consistent.
* **Feedback:** Even if you DNF, that’s okay — I’d love to know why, since that’s just as valuable as finishing.

**Expectations:**

* Read each segment and give honest feedback on pacing, character, and emotional impact.
* Stick to the timeline — consistency helps a lot!

[In Progress] [73k] [Memoir] Kensington Beach,"**Looking for beta readers for my memoir,** ***Kensington Beach***

This is a raw, first-person memoir about addiction, homelessness, recovery, and survival. It starts in small-town Pennsylvania, with a restless kid who turns early curiosity about drugs into a life-defining spiral. The book follows the progression from marijuana and pills, to heroin and meth, to homelessness, jail, and repeated failed detoxes. It covers family fallout (including stealing from loved ones), near-death experiences, and the brutal street realities of Kensington, Philadelphia.

The narrative is gritty and unfiltered but also reflective, tracing not just the damage I did and endured, but the flickers of hope, love, and community that kept me alive. Later chapters explore the long, uneven climb toward recovery—drug court, sober houses, relapse cycles, and eventual breakthroughs.

It’s written to resonate with anyone who’s lived through addiction, loved someone caught in it, or wants an honest look at why people fall so deep and how survival is even possible.

*She chose his brother. Twice.*

Marie Sullivan spent twenty-two years meeting expectations—pristine grades, polished manners, obedience to her grandmother’s plans. Her only rebellion? Running to Cole Westwood, despite her feelings for his brother Dale.

Now a car accident throws them back together, and at the first opportunity, she chooses Cole—again. Yet dating him feels nothing like the freedom she imagined.

\*\*\*

Lydia—not her real name—watched the sobbing woman and tried to will herself to look interested.

""She's...she's trying to take my Albert. She says he loves her and not me. She...she...""

Lydia nodded as if by rote. She was on one side of the dingy motel room, and her potential client was on the other. She had her back to the wall, a lesson from long experience.

""It's okay. Just take a deep breath."" Lydia said.

The woman tried to wipe her eyes with her blouse but only smeared the layers of makeup caked on her face. Snot ran down her nose in long streams.

""I'm...I'm so sorry. You must think I'm a terrible person for even thinking about...about this.""

""Of course not. I'm here for a reason. We're both here for a reason. There's nothing you can tell me that I haven't heard before.""

She nodded her head. ""It's just that...that I'm NOT a terrible person. I don't even get parking tickets. But...but this WOMAN is tearing my family apart. My FAMILY.""

""I understand. What do we really have except family?"" she soothed.

""Thank you for saying that.""

""Of course."" Lydia resisted the urge to go across the room and wipe her dirty face. Her chosen career had a way of making her OCD even worse.

The woman forced herself back into composure. ""I guess you want to talk about business now.""

""Do you think you're ready for this?""

""Yes. Yes, for my family. For my CHILDREN.""

“She has to go,"" said Lydia.

""She has to go,"" the woman repeated.

""And that's what I'm here for. I make problems go away.""

The woman nodded her head. ""I want you to make HER go away.""

""Absolutely. I promise to make her go far away; so far you won't even remember what she looked like."" Lydia paused. ""Did you bring what I asked you to?""

""Yes,"" the woman said. She rummaged through an outsize purse and retrieved a large manila folder. ""This is what you told me you needed.""

Lydia stepped away from the wall and took the envelope from the woman's hands. She noticed that they weren't shaking any more. She opened the envelope and gave it the once over: pictures, phone logs, Tik-Tok and other social media.

“My Albert writes everything down. I have the PIN for his phone, his passwords, his address book. Everything.

Lydia closed the envelope. ""You've been very thorough. My PI can get everything else.""

The woman dived into her purse again and pulled out a second envelope: one you might mail a thick letter in. It’s sides were bulging.

Lydia took it and put it in her jacket pocket.

""Do...do you want to count it?""

""That's not necessary. I trust you,"" she lied smoothly. Trust was for rookies; but she knew someone desperate enough to hire her was not going to run a scam of her own.

""Is...is there any more?""

""No. I've got what I need. We just need to iron out the specifics. Do you want them to find the body?""

""No. I don't want the police involved at all. I don't want my children to know what happened to her.""

""They won't,"" Lydia said, meaning that it was up to her client to keep it to herself and gloss over any inconsistencies.

""How soon can you...can you make her disappear?""

""Don't worry about that. From now on, the less you know, the better. Did you hire the lawyer?""

""Yes, Stephanie Marks. I found her on TV.""

""Okay, good."" She had seen the ads too and knew of her work. She wasn't Johnny Cochran, but she fought hard for her clients, and that should be good enough.

Both of them knew, as if by instinct, that everything was in place; that there was no going back. ""How will I know it's over?""

""When she leaves him alone.""

The woman nodded. Her gaze was steady now. ""I can't thank you enough. I'd kill her myself if I knew how.""

""Well, that's what I'm here for. She's not getting away this time. You'll be free of his lies; your children will have their father again.""

""You said I should spend the night here.""

""It will deflect suspicion. Just put out the Do Not Disturb sign and bar the door. You'll be safe. I promise. But I have to go: it’s not safe for me to stay.""

The woman nodded her head. Lydia patted the folder and envelope, gave the woman's shoulder one final squeeze, and left her to her thoughts. Then she was outside, her mind forgetting everything except the way home. A small mercy. Over for now. And over for good, soon enough.",2,2,2025-08-23,welcomeOhm,Short Story,1.0

Title: Lessons in BL, Sex, Love and Rebirth

Blurb (feedback on this would also be appreciated): After a life of suffering, Jasiel found himself reborn into one of his favorite Boys Love novels, The Gangster and The Angel but as an extra. In the body of Kitti, he was excited to be able to see his favorite story unfold, to watch all the characters first hand. It was the dream of all BL fans and like them, he was just happy to be there and have a front row seat to the action. He didn’t care that he was just another faceless character in the crowd or that the world revolved around the main characters of the story to an almost cliché point.

But soon it turns out that BL novels lied and there were lesson he should have learned in order to survive his new life. Like, he should have never let things escalated when the main lead caught him exploring his newly discovered sex drive in the locker room bathrooms, and instead of reporting him or glaring in disgust, actually joined him. Or that he should’ve said ‘No’ even when he wanted to say ‘Yes’ because it was the first time he had ever felt desired and wanted. Or even that all ML were obsessive and predatory.  But he didn’t know and since that day everything slowly began to change and the world that he had grown to love slowly began to crumble, becoming something unrecognizable.

What is a BL fan to do when the light-hearted good boy-bad boy novel that he read seemed to be getting a lot darker that he expected? What lessons can he used to set everything right again? Or is it too late?

“Wait, he’s in a *mafia*?”



Excerpt:

Lesson 2:  **Manhwas lied!**

**Not everyone is reincarnated as an abnormally beautiful character.**

Jasiel had never wondered about life after death but according to his religion, he should be in either Eden or hell. Instead it felt like he was floating under water or maybe he was submerge and was kept there by some invisible force. Yet he didn’t feel like he was drowning; on the contrary, he felt calm and at peace. It was unclear how long he had been submerged, but at some point he went from an actual person with a personality, memories, trauma, wants and desires to just a body, a blank canvas with nothing inside. He stopped being Jasiel and almost became a mannequin ready for the finishing touches that would make him a doll. Still, the body had enough awareness to wonder and understand that something was different, wrong or just strange. 

‘Who were they?’

‘What were they doing here?’

‘Who were they meant to be?’

Despite the uncertainty of the situation, there was only silence and peace; for some reason the body wanted to stay there. “Is that all you want?” A soft voice broke through the peaceful silence. “Do you not wish to have more? Why survive when you can live,” the voice was hypnotic yet it held a touch of surprise and confusion in its tone.

The soft voice seemed to compel the floating body like a captain leading a boat. It filled him with warmth and a glow that he could see through his closed eye lids. “Jasiel, my dear…” The body shuddered and suddenly remembered who they were.

‘That’s right, I was a boy,’ he thought. ‘My name was Jasiel and I died.’

“Do you want to go back?” the soft voice asked, they sounded closer than before.

‘Back? Back where?’ his mouth had yet to open; still, the soft voice heard him.

“Back home, to your live.”

‘My life?’ He didn’t remember his life and he wondered if it was a good one, if it was worth returning to. Did he have a family that loved him and would miss him, friends mourning him and begging to have him back? Did he die surrounded by love and affection?

“Oh, my dear,” there was so much pity in that voice and Jasiel could almost feel hands caress his head like a parent consoling their child after they lost a game. “I’m so sorry,” the words said more and spoke louder than any full sentence could.

It was enough of an answer for him and his memories as well because suddenly he was bombarded by flashes of a snarling woman yelling at him, memories of being alone in a placed that looked abandoned, of getting beat up by a bunch of guys, of no one really caring and he knew all his questions were answered. He didn’t want to go back to his old life.

‘Can I stay here?’ He wondered yet without even looking he knew that answer was no, the owner of the soft voice was warm but in that moment it felt regretful and guilty.

“But fret not, I will give you a better life. What you do you wish for?” the soft voice asked him, eagerly almost as if trying to lighten his mood. “Just say the word and it shall be yours. Money, fame, power, family, love…anything.”

Jasiel thought about the offer and he couldn’t help but compare it with his own life. It would be easy to say that he wanted the opposite of what he lived, that he wanted what he did not have then. But deep down he knew that wouldn’t make him happy. That was not what he wanted, money would be nice but it wouldn't make things better, it would just create new, more and different problems.

He knows that fame would be too much, he might not remember a lot about his previous life but he remembered that he didn’t like attention. Power, might be nice but he doesn’t trust himself to be able to wield it without abusing it. He remembered that his name was religious, ‘the strength of God’ but on him those were just words, for him, there was no meaning behind it. He was no warrior of God and he was even sure that his mother did not pick the name of its meaning.

The though of having another family made him shudder; he just couldn’t associate families with anything good or happy. And the last one, love, this one had him pausing, and it made him think. He wondered if he ever felt love or if someone had ever loved him. As much as he tried, he couldn’t think of such a time. Thinking of love, made flashes of words and color pictures fill his mind. He almost smiled at the version of love he had read about, but as sweet as it was at times, it also sounded complicated. But those stories he read made him so happy.

‘I want to be able to read my stories in peace and unbothered by life,’ he finally decided with a wistful sigh.

What he really meant was that he wanted no responsibilities or expectations; he just wanted to live life as carefree and happy as possible. He didn’t want to have to stop living just to deal with his mother or to work until he passed out because the rent was due. He didn’t want to flitch when he heard a woman speaking loudly, or limit himself because he had to safe in case others needed money. As bad as it sounded, he wanted to be selfish for once in his life.

“Hm,” the being made a pensive sound almost as if trying to figure out if this was possible or if they wanted to fulfill this wish. It felt like hours had passed before the beings spoke once more.

“Very well, I will give you your stories to enjoy as long as you want and when you fall, I will change it until you find true *happiness*.” Those words were meant to sound like a promise but to him they felt like a threat. There was a strange tone in the way they said ‘happiness’, almost as if it was some secret power that Jasiel had not figure out how to truly wield. But he had no time to process any of it because he soon felt himself be engulfed by something gooey and cold, like slim. It covered his body and for a moment he couldn’t breath. Then he felt his bones crack and twisted as if he was being deformed. As his bones started to settle, his flesh was pulled and stretched, like the elastic band on pants that should fit but don’t. Yet despite all this he didn’t feel the pain that should come with it.

‘What…?’ he was confused.

“Well, Jasiel is still dead” the soft voice replied to his unasked question. “And even I cannot bring the dead back, but I can find certain loopholes.”

His body felt strange and not his own but at the same time completely his. He felt a kiss on his forehead, followed by tender whispered words, “have fun and find your happiness.”

He opened his eyes for the first time, just to be overwhelmed by a blinding bright light. His senses felt like they were overloaded, he tried to focus on a single one but there were so many new smells and sounds that it was hard. Even the air tasted differently and as things became clearer he heard a new voice talking in a strange pitch that as he focused he realized was actually a completely different language from the ones he knew. The language sounded familiar as if he had heard it before but he didn’t understand it. The more he focused the more confused he became but the pull continue until he had no option but to let it take him.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

“*Ûan, Ûan, Ûan*!” A voice called instantly before yelling in frustration. He was finally able to open his eyes without being blinded by light, only to see an Asian young man glaring down at him. “*I swear I’m only waking you up because I owe you one,*” the man scoffed with a glare. “*But you sleep like you’re dead* so consider us even.”

He wanted to ask the man what he just said but half way through the rant, Jasiel began to understand him as if the man was speaking English. He also realized that the man was speaking Thai and almost like notification in his brain, he learned that they were in Thailand but everything else was a mystery. The man didn’t stick around for more, he was wearing what Jasiel knew to be a college uniform, at least according to the Thai BLs he’s read.

‘Was I reincarnated?’ he wondered with confusion. ‘Why in Thailand?’

The slamming of the door snapped him out of his thoughts and gave him the chance to look around. He was clearly in a door room which was smaller than he had seen in the few dramas he was able to watch in the public library’s computers. There were two beds like in most dorms and they were separated by a stair formed storage wooden structure.

In front of the beds there was more wood wardrobe and cupboards that took up most of the wall yet the room still felt big. Then Jasiel saw that on his roommate’s side there was a window but no balcony. He decided to snoop around his things but all he found in his storage was snacks with just a little space for like three to four outfits besides his uniform.

“Okay, so now me likes to eat, that’s…good.” His hand felt something under the pillow, as he search he found a half-eaten snack that had him groaning, “at least I have priorities, I guess.”

Eventually he found his phone and saw that his background was a sexy anime guy instead of girl, “that’s progressive.” He felt like that was a point in his new body's favor. There was no passcode to the phone which was either extremely sad or stupid. His gallery was filled with pictures of random things, no people other than anime characters and what looked like celebrities. “So not very social, I can deal with that. In fact, I prefer it.” All the way at the bottom, there was a picture of a woman and a man; something told him they were his new parents.

In his snooping, he checked the last texts from ‘Mae’ and ‘Phaw’ which he now knew meant mother and father, ‘I know Thai now!’ He felt a little giddy at that, mainly because now he could read more BLs. As he focused back on his phone, he saw that the text from ‘Mae’ weren’t really caring or loving but they weren’t cold and harsh like his first mother. This mother seemed to just be interested in him eating better. Thinking about all the snacks he saw, he couldn’t blame her.

**You need to lose weight, Ûan** 

He read the last text and was a little discouraged, it seemed that these parents weren’t attentive either but thinking more about it this was better than the alternative. He also wouldn't know what to do with attentive parents if he had them. He did notice that there was no term of endearment between them. He remembered that in Thailand people had nicknames as well as their birth name and last name, the middle of which they rarely used unless it was for official business and latter was almost never used.

He briefly remembered that it has something to do with last names being relatively new in the country and by new he means in the last hundred-something years. He had thought it was a strange concept since even official people, like teachers, boss, and police men, would use nicknames to address you. He couldn’t picture a teacher calling him shorty, four eyes, or something like that.

Then he thought about kids with names like Bartholomew, Karen, Atticus, and many other pretentious or ‘trendy’ names parents force on their children, for them to be able to take back control and chose what they would be addressed as by everyone without getting an expensive and stressful name change sounded amazing. Still, he was not amused when he noticed that his Thai nickname basically meant fat and he thought how that nickname was definitely given to him by other people because unless he had the worse self-esteem, he wouldn’t chose that for himself.

“How original,” he rolled his eyes at the seemingly acceptable form of bullying. “That doesn’t hurt my feelings at all,” he declared sarcastically with a scoff. He turned back to the last text from his father which to his surprise was in a language he understood from his previous life, it also provided him with his actual name.

**Kittisak, I send this month’s money.**

**It should already be in your account.**

**Use it wisely.**

Again there was no care or love in there just a transaction; his mind provided the detail that his father was American so he was half Thai. “With a name like Kittisak, you would think my nickname would be Kitti, but no, I get Ûan.” Jasiel decided that he was going to switch his nickname, being called fat by everyone he knew and met was not something he was willing to live with. He’ll have everyone call him Kitti from now on. He sent his parents a text updating them on his new name change which was not approved.

**You’re more of a Ûan.**

**You think you’re a Kitti? What are you a cute girl?**

His father was clearly laughing and his mother was offended which told him that she had been the one to curse him with the name that he swore to change. ‘At least the replied right away,’ he thought, trying to see the positive side.

From the text history, he found out that his parents travel a lot since his father was a travel writer and that they were currently in Italy. They also never take him on their travels which was fine by him because they always sent him a comfortable amount of money to pay his dorm while also keep him happy and on top they also paid his tuition. He also learned that he was an art major specifically theatre, which he was pretty sure was not chosen by him. He found the papers for a major change to graphic design in one of his drawer so theatre was definitely not his choice.

“Okay, time to get up and explore.”

As got off the bed and stretched, he almost felt his bones thank him, it was clear that the new him was used to being hunched over and didn’t really care. “First thing first,” he made his way to the bathroom, although he wasn’t sure where it was but there was only one other door in the room beside the entrance door. He passed a mirror on his way there and finally saw his new appearance.

“That explains a lot,” he simply said with an ‘hm’.

At the first look of his new body, he suddenly understood his lack of pictures of himself and his nickname. He had tan skin, not quite golden but more a soft orange, if he was poetic he would say it was a warm honey. But seeing that he was Thai, that wasn’t too strange, it was the puffy, chipmunk cheeks and flabby arms that he was focused on. Lifting his shirt he saw that he definitely had a few love handles but a lot of his fat seemed to be concentrated on his hips and thighs.

In the States, his body would be compare to a curvy Latina woman instead of being fat, maybe even chubby, ‘I mean my man boobs are barely a B-cup,’ he thought. But he also knew that here he would no doubt be considered obese. He wasn’t trying to justify his weight, it was clear that he could lose a few pounds. He still jiggled in all the wrong places but then again, “it could be worse.”

He had short black hair that fell on his forehead like the creepy nerd in mangas, ‘all I’m missing was the glasses that illogically shadowed my eyes.’ Either way the fringe was good because his forehead was kind of big. His eyes were rounder than he was used to seeing in other Asians but that could be from his half American side. They were a plain brown color that weren’t very exciting, even as Jasiel, his brown eyes had flecks of green in them. These eyes were just brown, boring, plain, average brown. He did have pouty lips which he actually checked weren’t swollen.

“That looks weird,” he declared as he poked at them. He looked almost like Mr. Potato, made out of parts from different vegetables. “And my mother thought it was a good idea to put me in theatre,” he exclaimed, incredulously.

As soon as he finished checking himself out, he took the time to brush his teeth and bathe, checking out his new body. Apparently even with air conditioning he sweated like a live pig in a barbeque. Once he was done, his stomach growled and Jasiel thought about possible putting himself on a diet but then he remembered that this was his new life.

“Why try and make myself miserable,” he shrugged the idea away and after putting on some clothes left the room, eager to explored. He did get little flashes of memories, things that he would normally not know like where Ûan’s favorite place to eat was. It was a little sad how many times the boy ate there, alone but what might seem sad to others could be pure bliss for some. Jasiel vowed to enjoy this life to the fullest and do only the things that make him happy which meant buying some books and BLs. He giggled at the thought of actually getting to read a Thai BL without the translations that could sometimes mess them up.

“This is going to be the best new life ever!” He was so happy, wiggling and moving around that he knocked someone with his hips.

“Sorry,” he pleaded as he bend down, his hands clapped together, something that he seemed to do automatically.

‘At least my body knows the traditions and etiquette, that’s one less thing I have to worry about.’

“*Watch* where you’re going next time?” a musical –very rock and roll– voice sneered. He wonders if he bumped into the typical bully or grumpy bad boy. He decided it better not to lift his head so that the man would not be able to recognize him later on.

“I will, *Khun*.” That term also came out of nowhere but he knew what it meant and it seemed to pacify the man who just continued walking in a huff.

He waited a few seconds before lifting his head; he turned to see the back of a tall young man. The man was clearly over six feet and he had the cliché delinquent, bleached blond hair but it seemed to work on him, although the leather jacket was a little too much. He even got a glimpse of tattoos and at the glare of something shining in the sun, he also notice that the man had piercings.

“I thought those things were only seen in dramas or anime,” he chuckled at it before continuing his journey to get food and then books. He was too far away to hear as someone called to the textbook delinquent and had him turning around.

“P’Yài, wait up!” another male exclaimed. “Where were you last night?”

“What are you my mother?” The blond man sneered. “And cut the ‘phi’ shit, you’re older than me.”

“But isn’t it cuter this way?” The shorter man asked putting on a whining tone to his voice and rubbing his cheek on the taller man’s broad shoulder.

“No.”

“So mean,” the friend whined. “Okay, I’ll call you nong.”

“Ai’Bank,” there was a warning to to blonde’s voice.

“Hm?”

“I rather you not call me at all.”

“My nong is so mean!” The shorter man whined loudly gaining attention from those around them. The tall man walked away completely ignoring him but the other man followed still whining all the way.                                      ",3,5,2025-08-22,LMSantanabooks,>100k,0.8
[Complete] [73k] [Dark Fantasy/Horror] A BOOK ABOUT A DEAD GIRL,"Hello friends! I am looking for a beta reader or two for my adult novel, ""A Book About a Dead Girl."" one of my writing partners is having a fam emergency and I really need more feedback in the next two weeks, thus here I am! I'll post the pitch I'm working on for the query here.

In a world where the Dept. of Cryptid Capture shields US civilians from supernatural creatures beyond the veil, Agent 427 wakes up with a lost memory. His bosses seem suspicious, and a fellow Agent slides him a secret before he’s discharged: check in the cabinet to the left of the sink in your kitchen, and Don’t. Tell. Anyone. What he finds inside is a sagging file box, containing incident reports, VHS’s, audio tapes, and journal entries. Finn Baxter powers up the keurig and gets to work sorting through it all. 

Everything in the box is about one patient, a schizoaffective bastard child of North Fork royalty named Alexandra Frost, who was admitted to the NoFo psych ward on assault charges. The admittance doesn’t seem as important to her than getting a message across to whoever will listen: an old hallucination of hers is trying to become corporeal in order to kill her.

And there’s no way that could be true… Or could it?

As Agent 427 chronicles Alex’s journey, he discovers the real reason he has this information: he knew Alex previously and was in the ward himself, and while he broke out, Alex never did. Now he has to go back and get her out, because it turns out the fate of the balanced world might rest on Alex Frost’s very unstable shoulders. 

Notes: It's an #ownvoices novel (I have schizoaffective disorder). I also feel like it falls off at the end and could really use insight into that. TW: body horror, suicidal ideation

I am super down to critique swap as well; I don't like feeling indebted to people lol. But if you are just offering a beta read a thank you in advance. <3",4,15,2025-08-21,Same-Boysenberry4777,70k,0.75
[Complete][150k][Dark Fantasy] Savor,"
First time author ready to move forward with my long term project. Due to the initial high word count, I’ve sliced my book in half and edited down another 30k words to meet the fantasy quota. (It still feels high but I’m considering cutting out a surprise POV that pops up now and again. It offers vantage point from enemy lines) I’m hoping it feels like a standlone with the direct intent to be a series. 

 - Savor is an adult epic fantasy with multiple POV’s that delves into the plot from every angle. It is fast paced and features an array of characters who are recovering in a world brought to near extinction by the hands of their creator. You’ll explore themes of self sacrifice, abuse of power, and the muddied lines between heroes and villains. 

- Content warning: Violence, abuse, some coarse language, grief, and death 

- Feedback: this is my first jump into this nightmare of queries, blurbs, revisions, and preparation to submit this as a published work. Any and all feedback is helpful! 

- Brief synopsis: After decades of isolation, an omnipotent being will choose to save humanity or let them perish during the comings of a fated apocalypse.
 

- Full Blurb: 

Quasars, the Shepards of Progress, have abandoned their mortal flock after an attempted extermination known as the Quietus. Their spawn, known as Deities, are incarnations of dark and light, who wander aimlessly in their stead. The Nox utilize their gifts as weapons of war while the Lux are relegated to healers.

In decades following the Quietus, Rikaiju is set to become the next Sovereign of his kingdom, but the Lux wall established by his Father has made his home feel more like a prison. One evening, he receives a letter from his estranged mother on the eve of the annual wall lapse. Rikaiju jumps at the chance to rendezvous, but it is revealed that the letter is a fallacy, exposing Tyl to an invasion. Tyl falls, the Sovereign is slain, and Rikaiju assumes his Lux Deity. 

Over the course of his journey to return home, Rikaiju’s destiny intersects with the vestiges of a world torn asunder by the Quietus. A Quasar and Nox who are direct descendants of fabled heroes. An Ambassador tasked with instilling the mortal condition to the cold Quasars. Lastly, the Aphelion responsible for his Father’s demise whose cold hands he can still feel around his throat. 

In his quest for vengeance, Rikaiju must learn the utilize his abilities and vanquish the enemy who enslaved his kingdom. But negative emotions cannot fuel his Lux, only affirmations. 

- Critique: I’m looking for critiques of the first few chapters. If you’re hooked I’d be happy to send more. Please DM me and we’ll see where we go from there. I am still new to this process so please give me grace. Full disclosure, I work full time in the service industry with a variety of hours. I’d be happy to commit to a few chapters to swap but time constraints do not work well for me. 

- A little background about me: I’ve been writing/roleplaying all my life and thought I’d give light to all these characters I’ve had for years. I bartend full time at a luxury hotel and I’m obligated to a ton of social events on my days off. Video games, movies, and anime have inspired my work and you’ll definitely see hints of it speckled throughout. My father and a friend have read Savor as a whole and they adored it.

[Complete][58k][Fantasy - New Adult - Queer] You are my sharpest sin - Underworld Trials,"Hello, I recently finished my novel and have been looking for any feedback what so ever on if it's good enough for publishing. Would love some feedback on the whole thing, even if you DNF what made you lose interest, even your thoughts on the title of the book! etc etc.

Synopsis:

August Rook doesn’t remember dying but he wakes in the Underworld with only a Grim Reaper as his guide and thrown into the ten soul trials to account for his sins. Each judgement brings him closer to reincarnation or eternal damnation. Hesitant at first, August dives straight in to the trials with no other option available than through, motivated by his ambitious nature and desires to leave a legacy in the world. When he learns the Reaper’s own soul are tangled together, August must decide if saving him is worth risking his second chance at life. Or perhaps that there is so much more than a simple desire to leave a mark in the world. 

Drawing on ancient Korean mythology and the Ten Courts of the Underworld and the role of a Grim Reaper, the book weaves a story of fate. longing, and the price of redemption.

Excerpt from opening (prologue):  
The only thing he could see was blue. A shade pulled from a corpse, a deathly blur of blue that belonged to drowned flesh. From the haze, the creature prowled out, muscles rippling beneath the fur. Each precise step wrought with lethality. 

A tiger, he thought. But wrong, bigger. Stranger. Stormy blue fur. Wearing an ancient face stitched together from a lion, tiger stripes. Beady eyes. A dragon snout. 

A chimera. 

August Rook is stubbornly logical. He vividly remembers his grandmother saying a tiger would escort her to the afterlife but he never believed her. Not until he found himself staring at the chimera tiger, its fur ghostly pale like frost, eyes glowing like fire, fangs protruding.

It looked at him. Predatory eyes locking. A red, soul-penetrating glare. One look, and he felt the air thin in his lungs, like time itself was holding its breath. As if the world had run out of air, and he was drowning on land. Numbed into nothing.

That’s when August Rook realized he was being collected by Death. And it had sent its prettiest monster.

Trigger Warnings: some violence, pretty stereotypical of fantasy. Swords etc.

If you love:

\* Trials

\* East Asian culture/mythology

\* Soulmates

\* possibly Kpop Demon HUnters

Please consider giving my story a chance! The book is based on the Korean cultural folklore of the Grim Reaper (jeosung saja) and the Underworld journey.

I need people who are going to stay active and not vanish after a few days!

I will give you the link to the private beta reader subreddit once you sign the NDA!

All trigger warnings are in the NDA. But! please note this novel has mature, adult and extreme horror lit themes. It is inspired by Poppy Z Brite's Lost Souls, Clive Barker's works, early Stephen King, Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and a bit of Vampire The Masquerade.

Nyxhaven is the opening verse of The Vampire Scriptures: a nihilist’s hymn to grief, obsession, and the void at the heart of meaning where everything humanity clings to is meaningless.

Sanctuary is a haunted, broken, teenager, her family shattered by her sisters’ deaths. When the cracks in her parents grow too deep, she's dumped into Nyxhaven’s neon rot, where nightclubs pulse like dying hearts and the air reeks of decay. In a forgotten record shop, she is drawn to a recalled album by Ashriel’s band. The record becomes her only anchor in a world outside her tightknit but splintering friend group. A world full of fangs like sharpened needles that wouldn’t notice, wouldn't care, if she vanished.

The music sinks into her, a ghost that fills the hollow space where she once was.

She becomes convinced Ashriel is the only one who sees her. Sees her pain, her ragged soul. Shares in the abyss that is swallowing her very mind. She's wrong. He doesn’t. But it doesn’t matter. She doesn’t matter, but what difference does it make?

None.

Nyxhaven is a living maw, ready to devour anyone too weak to fight back. Here, one-sided devotion is a cage; misguided attachment, a trap. And when the record ends, there’s only silence. Human dreams are pigs to slaughter in this city. There is no hope for the broken girl chasing a shadow, a song, a feeling she can never touch. Nyxhaven is devotion without return, a haunting that erases the self until nothing remains but a hollow echo. A dying scream into the never ending hunger of what lurks in the neon soaked darkness.",0,3,2025-08-21,TheYaoiEmpire,>100k,0.5

I worried I was going to have to talk about Tabitha—about my mom. Didn’t they make you tell your story if you were new? Was this like AA? Was I going to have to stand and say “Hi, I’m Alyssa and I’m an orphan?”

I clawed in my pocket for a couple more downers. I thought it might have been an Ativan and a Lexapro, but I wasn’t sure. I popped them in my mouth without examination. I breathed deep, feeling the pills make their way down my throat and into my stomach. I pictured them there, like seeds, sinking into my stomach lining, waiting to sprout. I listened to the room. The soft *shuss* of the pastry boxes being opened and closed, a quickly stifled laugh from the smokers outside. 

A voice spoke next to me.

“Will you be joining us—we’re just getting ready to start.”

I started, looking around. A man with a round face and a nose like a tomato was looking down at me. The redness and broken capillaries under his skin were an instant tell for alcohol abuse. I opened my mouth to respond, but so many thoughts crowded in my head that they got tangled.

“Do I have to go?” 

I had meant to say *Do I have to speak?* And that got tangled up with *I have to go.* He stared for a moment, then decided to interpret my gibbering.

“You mean speak in the circle? Not if you don’t want to. We have lots of folks who just come and listen. Though we do encourage you to eventually speak, there’s no requirements here except to be respectful to each other.” He extended his hand.

“Jeremy,” he said. I hesitated, but shook, mumbling my name. 

The air around me started to glimmer, the Ativan combining wonderfully with the Vicodin. Some of the tension in my shoulders eased. The hard edges softened enough for me to enter the circle.

[Complete] [98k] [YA Fantasy] Don't Feed the Gods,"Hi, everyone. I'd love to get a beta reader or two for my YA fantasy novel, Don't Feed the Gods. I'd be happy to do a critique swap, ideally with someone in a similar genre.

**Blurb:** Hundreds of years ago, the Kordu, a race of humans who all have some form of elemental magic, colonized the island of the Jandi, and fifty years ago, they claimed to have banished the Jandi Gods over the seas. But Barnsley, a 17-year-old Jandi stable boy, discovers that the Gods haven't actually banished; they've been imprisoned under the Kordu Castle. He manages to free one of the Gods. They flee the Castle and seek allies to free the rest of the Gods and free the Jandi from Kordu rule.

  
**Excerpt:** Here's the opening:

  
Barnsley squinted at the sign placed on the ornate metal grating, trying to read the words by the flickering orange light of his dwindling torch. It couldn’t say “Don’t feed the Gods,” could it? It was in Kordu, which he didn’t know as well as Jandeen. He wouldn’t know either if his Gramps hadn’t secretly taught him to read. But he was pretty sure that was what it said. Which didn’t make any sense, and didn’t help. Didn’t make any sense because the Kordu had defeated and banished the Goddesses over the ocean fifty years ago, and didn’t help because the metal grate totally blocked the passageway he’d been heading down, hoping to find his way back above ground before his torch first scorched his hand, then burned out.



He’d been sent down here to the floors beneath the Castle to find turnips for the horses he took care of. Or, rather, for the Kordu grooms, who officially took care of the horses, to give to them. AllAlll he officially took care of was the barn, and he wasn’t even in charge of that.



But the pantry hadn’t been where he’d thought, and each turn that he believed would get him closer seemed to get him more lost instead. Plus he kept having to duck under low entranceways, and had bumped his head once. Sometimes being tall was an advantage, but not here. He’d finally found the pantry, and had a bag of turnips slung over his shoulder, but then somehow he’d gotten even more lost trying to find his way back. Until he’d come to this dead end, capped with a grate made of thick iron bars twisted into strange geometric patterns, the ends dug into the rough stone walls, ceiling, and floor. And that ridiculous sign.



His fear of the torch burning out and leaving him lost in the dark overcame his curiosity, so he started to turn and find his way back when he heard a low, raspy cough, then a deep rumbly voice say, “Hey, kid, don’t go.”



“I’m not a kid!” Barnsley said heatedly. He wasn’t: he was seventeen years old, almost eighteen, and he’d helped take care of his mom and little sister since his dad left when he was ten.



“Ok. Hey, fully grown man, don’t go,” said the voice. It seemed to be coming from the other side of the metal grate, close by, but he couldn’t see anything - the light of the torch gleaming off the metal left everything behind it in darkness.



“I have to go - my torch is burning out.”



“No it isn’t.”



“Yes it…” Barnsley trailed off, staring down at his suddenly two–foot-long torch which would last hours. “I’m sorry, Sir. I didn’t know you were a Kordu. Please excuse my rudeness.” It seemed like odd magic, though - a torch, the wood and oil-soaked rags part that had been restored, wasn’t Earth, Fire, Air, or Water. Maybe it counted as Fire, he didn’t know, he was just a Jandi servant.



“I’m not a blasted Kordu, kid. I mean, man.”



“Well, then, what are you?”



“I’m a God. Don’t you recognize me?”



With that, Barnsley turned and fled. This time, he found his way out with no trouble at all.

[Complete] [104K] [Satire / Magical Science Fiction] The Hero's Neighbor,"Hi! Below you'll find the important things to know about the book and what I'm hoping to get out of a beta reader. If you're interested, please let me know! I'm open to critique swapping (more details below)

# The Blurb

""A hero is about to embark on the most important quest in the universe, his fate intertwined with a great evil that must be stopped to restore balance to the galaxy. His story has been prophesied for millennia. It is possible that he is the most important person ever born. 

This book is *not* about that hero.

Mack Robinson is a space garbage man with a simple life and simple desires. His favorite blorpball team has advanced to the final match in this season’s bracket, and Mack wants nothing more than to attend it in person.

Doing so is well out of his budget. Or rather, it *would* be, if not for a mysterious new work assignment that, if handled properly, might just be the solution to all of his problems…""

# Content/Audience

This book contains some violence, very tame/infrequent language, and no sexually explicit/suggestive content. This book would likely be classified as YA, though it is meant to be equally entertaining for adults.

This book is very satirical of other “hero’s journey” stories, such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings. The references I make throughout the book are meant to be obvious, though importantly I try not to be outright derivative about too many things. In other words, this book is not another “Space Balls.” There is an actual story beneath the comedy that I hope will be interesting for readers.

# Expectations

I am expecting readers to finish the book by October 31st, 2025 so that I can revise the book based on their feedback before the end of the year. Readers are able to provide as much feedback as they want in basically any format. The only minimum requirements that I have are to answer 1-2 questions at the end of each chapter to gauge your thoughts.

I am **happy to do critique swapping**. I am not terribly picky on whether the book lengths are comparable, though I am not interested in reading any sexually explicit content.

# Excerpt

Larry simply smiled. “Oh man, that’s quite the story. We were sailing across the crystalline oceans of Borax-IX when a local division of the Consortium began attacking…” He spun a wild tale of battles, deception, and rescue by the hands of Lyriel and BP-93. Mack found that it was hard to pay attention to it all. The kid made it sound like it was some big inside story that his misfit group had shared for years, when in reality—based on his own haphazard timeline—it couldn’t have happened more than a few days ago at most. 

“...and so, it was only logical that Lyriel and BP-93 would bring us to the other members of the Pushbackers to meet them.” This transition shocked Mack back to his senses.

“Pushbackers?” he asked, though he almost didn’t want to know.

“Yes, the Pushbackers,” Larry said, misinterpreting Mack’s incredulity as mere confusion. “I forget, most people haven’t heard of them. They’re a group of beings who still fight against the Consortium. They ‘push back’ against the tyranny, and–”

“Stop,” Mack said, a bit exasperated. “Run it back. Help me see how this \*isn’t\* a joke. The group of people who resist, oppose, or otherwise rebel against the government call themselves the…Push…backers?”

“I don’t see what your issue is,” Larry said. Lyriel and Obby were nodding in agreement.

“It’s a completely sensible name,” the elf defended. 

Mack just shook his head. \*Not worth it,\* he thought to himself. The others might be able to say that name straight-faced, but he doubted that he ever could.",6,7,2025-08-19,BetterDisplay1168,>100k,1.0
[COMPLETE] [100k] [LITERARY POST-APOCALYPTIC DRAMA] Those Who Remain/TBD,"Seeking a few beta readers for my Adult Literary Post-apocalyptic drama, Those Who Remain/TBD.

It is a completed work with just under 100k words. Isaiah and his family, living in a bunker following a series of extreme weather phenomena. Their rough yet content life is interrupted by a man whose polished demeanor doesn’t belong in the wreckage of the world. His presence rips Isaiah from his secluded life into the carnage of the human psyche. He is shown what people are truly capable of. From cannibals to wealthy collectors, to a new found friend, the limits of the mind and the widely varying effects of trauma and loneliness are explored thoroughly. A single coin guides his path to a discovery that not everything is at it seems.

I am primarily seeking grand-scheme edits. Are the relationships and arcs well thought out? Do you feel connected to the story? Is it interesting? Do you feel the ending shocked you while also wrapping up everything into a nice little bow? Those sort of things. I am still polishing the grammar and vocabulary, but if you happen to find anything that stands out, I wouldn’t turn that away. 

This is an intended to be an adult novel. There are themes of mental instability as well as some gore (of course, theres cannibals after all). Though, the main premise of the story is showing how such a scenario can impact people differently. It is has thriller aspects but it is more so a literary drama.

I'm done with the fifth draft and have received generally positive feedback so far, but I'd like more feedback now that I've changed a few character arcs and scenes. 

**FEEDBACK REQUESTED**: Developmental feedback and deeper layer criticisms only. I WILL consult a professional editor for line edits and proof reads, but for now I want to focus on how engaging the story actually is. Focus on characterisation, pacing, worldbuilding and plot please.

**TIMELINE**: 1 month

**CRITIQUE SWAP:** Not for full manuscripts as currently I have my hands full. I am happy to critique excerpts of your work, and potentially in a half a month's time offer full manuscript critiques.

**TRIGGER WARNINGS:** Oh boy where do we start... Child exploitation, the implication of rape, child trafficking, death, child death, animal abuse, child abuse, gore, mentions of rape, racism, slavery and self harm. Please only respond to this post if you are comfortable to read books with very dark themes and explorations.

I am willing to share the first chapter with those interested to see if we'd be a good match, but for now here are the first few paragraphs (I am currently struggling with a blurb...).

**EXCERPT (CHAPTER ONE - TO CULL A CHILD):**

If Ravaryn ever knew remorse, it perished long ago under the command of unapologetic sin. The kingdom hushes lambs before slaughter, but leaves its orphans to weep.

The bite of morning frost from summer’s dying breath woke me long before the kettle screams the alert of breakfast. Children and toddlers knock elbows and knees as they yank themselves from their pillow-less and blanket-less beds and struggle to pull on their shoes. Many of them will not return tonight. No one knows where they go, no one asks why. The Reaper, the woman in charge of the orphanage, refuses to tell us. From working on the farms, I’ve learnt one thing—it’s better to hide the blade from the livestock before butchering.

Like rabbits panicking within a smoked-out den, the children push around each other, fighting for clothes without rips or stains before scurrying from the dormitory into the washroom.

Filip stirs beside me, his sleep-puffed lips murmuring his nightmares into the crook of my elbow. White flakes thicker than snow peel from his skin as I stroke his cheek, my cold knuckles paling crimson patches to milky hues. Another Harvest, another rash.

It’s my fault that there are no ointments left to help him. Last season, I stole a ream of silk from a wagon to trade with the apothecary woman. Had I known it was destined for the king, I would never have touched it. It took only the short walk from her home above the tavern to the markets for the Straights to recognise its value. The sweeps are still scrubbing her blood from the roadside. It’s a shame, really—she was a cheap trader, and her balms worked.

Filip’s murmurs bleed into whimpers that choke the lumped words of comfort from my throat. There’s little I can say to ease him today.",3,5,2025-08-19,A_M_MEDDOWS,>100k,0.72

[In progress] [2291] [Fantasy Lit-Rpg] Ch. 13 - The Gauntlet Chronicles,"Hello everyone,

I've been kicking around the idea of writing a fantasy book for a while now and recently decided to give it a go. I posted a few chapters on Royal Road to see what people's initial thoughts were and if there was any interest at all. After receiving some feedback, I am looking for beta readers to assist me with what seems to be an issue with underdeveloped characters.

# The Gauntlet Chronicles

When a terrifying cosmic System announces Earth's impending doom, an ordinary college student is plunged into an urban hellscape overrun by alien beasts. Driven by a desperate need to find and protect his family, he must tap into a pragmatic resilience he never knew he possessed. As stars vanish and his world crumbles, every kill in the System's brutal ""Gauntlet Store"" economy inches him towards personal strength.

One chance score, a strange pocket watch inscribed with Metatron’s cube, may be valuable enough to solve all his problems, but Rotello soon discovers it holds a secret that could change everything. Now he must contend with Prohibition gangsters, powerful tycoons, and a mysterious rival thief in order to claim his prize and save his father. Pursued at every turn, Rotello must turn to unexpected allies if he’s to unravel a conspiracy stretching across centuries and unlock the earth-shattering truth behind his very reality.*

* **Emotional Impact:** This story is a tragedy, and I need to know if it feels that way. Were there moments that resonated with you or shocked you? Does the full weight of the team's fracture and their individual losses truly hit home?
* **Thematic Resonance:** Most importantly, does the central theme land? The story explores the idea of heroism as a fragile, costly, and sometimes deceptive performance. Does this theme come through clearly in the characters' actions and their consequences?

I have attached an excerpt for you to dip your toes in and see if you like the story. If you like it please either DM or comment, and i'll send you the full thing.

[In progress] [18k] [Supernatural Fantasy] Battlefield: Divine,"**Summary:** 10 years ago, if you raised your head up to the skies, you could have seen the same thing no matter where you were: angels descending and being welcomed by nuclear missiles. What was supposed to be a quick affair and a brief Rapture, though, became a slog. Now, the world was split between places ruled by Angels and humans governors - the 'Kingdom of Heaven' - and places ruled by the Antichrist, self-entitled 'fighting for humanity against the false angels' - the 'Empire of Men'. In the middle of this, parts of the Earth are uncontrolled but tightly contested, inhabited only by nomadic humans, refugees of neither heaven nor hell. In East Africa, a group of refugees tried to defy this status quo by establishing a heavily defended fortress that is almost a medieval citadel - protected against angels and demons, against greedy and zealous humans  - where a group of people just want to live as life was before the Armageddon got stalled. One engineer finds them by luck and events run in a way that their small independence cry will become something far louder.

**Statement**: This is meant not to be an overly long book by any means. 9 arcs, in 3 books, 60-90k words each. I love high fantasy but I'm not bold enough to even believe I'm in the same stratosphere as GRRM or Robert Jordan. It is a mild hobby that I fancied to explore - and my wife, a damn good and creative writer, enjoyed my ideas. However, I asked a friend and his reply was, uh, tough. Not as in 'needs some polishing but good work so far', but instead 'unreadable, flat and uninteresting'. The plot idea was something it was liked, but one of the descriptions was 'a potent engine in a broken wheel cart'. I asked my wife and she pretty much said she was sugarcoating a bit. So, I want to know where I am and, if this is just to be a hobby that will be put in a folder after it is over, I'll not spend the hours that I did researching locations or changing ideas, I'll just let my finger flow and be happy with it. 

**Structure:** I wrote the end of Arc I plus a long flashback of one of the characters that will be broken - I want to use those flashbacks as 'intermissions' between parts of Act II, that will be significantly longer and involve a heist that will demand some character expansion. 

I do not want to hear good and positive ""keep it up, you're good"", I really just want to know if this will require the dedication for a long-term thing that may end in at least my mom receiving one of the 3 prints I'll make or if it'll be just a weekend fun and games where I can lead this whatever I want.",1,3,2025-08-17,StormTheTrooper,Novella,0.67
[Complete] [76k] [Psychological Thriller/Romance] Window Man,"**Summary:**

*She built a company to protect people’s privacy. Now someone was invading hers.*  
A man begins watching her from the apartment across the street. At first, she tries to ignore it. But when she catches a glimpse of him in other places, she’s pulled into a chilling hunt to uncover who he is... and why he always seems one step ahead.

**Genre:** Fast-paced psychological thriller with minor romance subplot  
**Length:** Full-length novel (but I'd be thrilled even if you just read the first few chapters or however much you want!)  
**Warnings:** Themes of mental health struggles, paranoia/psychosis

This is the first book I've ever written, so I'd love to know if it's any good at all. I'm worried that the writing in the beginning feels too straightforward/simple, as I was still trying to find my writer's voice. I usually love reading romance, but I learned that writing it was hard (I cringed a lot). I'd love to hear your thoughts on the romance, if it's unnecessary, or if it should be toned up/down. I also am not sure if this fits the YA genre due to the easy-to-digest writing style and tame romance plot.

I spent about four months straight working on this, so I'm really in need of a few fresh pairs of eyes. All honest feedback is welcome!

**Swap info:** I'm willing to swap if it's Thriller or Romance (contemporary only)

[Complete] [95K] [Dark Romance Literary Fiction w/ Speculative Fantasy] Sin Senses Consensus,"Hello readers,

I’m seeking a handful of thoughtful beta readers for my debut novel *Sin Senses Consensus*, a complete 95,000-word work of erotic psychological literary fiction with threads of magical realism, dark academia and spirituality.

**Short Pitch:** In a last-ditch effort to save humanity from divine erasure, a celestial guardian angel scribe writes the story of Kaly, a gifted but lost mid-twenties woman entangled in taboo power dynamics with a sadistic professor and a conflicted priest. As Kaly navigates her sensual awakening, faith, and submission, her transformation becomes a spiritual offering — one that might make God fall in love with His creation again and delay the apocalypse.

*Sin Senses Consensus* is a provocative, poetic debut exploring power, eroticism, faith, and the redemptive power of self-mastery.

**What I’m Looking For:** Honest feedback on reader experience: clarity, pacing, character arcs, and emotional resonance. Insight into what’s working, what confuses, and what lingers after reading. Completion of a short, 15-question feedback form at the end (designed to guide your reflections and make it easy!)

**What I Offer in Return:** I’m open to quid pro quo beta swaps and would be glad to read your work in exchange. Flexible, constructive feedback tailored to what you’re looking for

**Content Warnings:** Graphic sexual content (BDSM, consensual non-consent, physical punishment) · Psychological manipulation (power imbalances, gaslighting, emotional abuse) · Mental health struggles (depression, intrusive thoughts, dissociation, anxiety) · Religious taboo (clergy in sexual/power roles, challenges to faith) · Shame and unhealthy coping · Dark romance tropes (morally ambiguous/toxic dynamics, dubious consent) · Trauma and recovery explored in erotic/romantic contexts

If you have any questions or concerns about the content, comment below. 

And If this sounds like your kind of read, please DM me with your interest and your email, and I’ll send you a Google Doc link of my manuscript. I am flexible with the deadline, but 2 weeks to a month seems doable. And perfectly acceptable if you choose to not continue to read further, just let me know.

Thank you for considering reading my book. You may be a beta reader but you're an alpha in my heart.

[Complete] [100K] [MM Omegaverse] Fae Romantasy,"Hi everyone! I am Kiara Lux. I just finished my first MM Omegaverse novel—it’s a Fae romantasy, very character-driven—and I’m looking for readers who might be interested in beta reading it for me.

💜 **CALLING FOR BETA READERS!!** 💜

MM // OMEGAVERSE // (NO MPREG) // 3 Peppers Spice // 100K length

**Being whisked away by a hot fae prince to his magical realm feels like the beginning of my very own fairy tale—until I realize he's promised to someone else.**

When Keegan, a mysterious and handsome man, walks into the pet salon where I work, my world flips upside down. His presence electrifies my once dull routine, and the more time he spends around me, the harder it is to ignore the way my feelings for him grow.

Then everything takes a bizarre turn, when someone tries to kidnap me, and Keegan—my unsettlingly intense new patron—decides the best way to keep me safe is to take me with him... to the land of the Fae.

Who wouldn’t trade a mundane life for a world of magic, danger, and a powerful, charming prince at their side?

**There’s just one catch.** Keegan isn’t just royally out of my league—he’s an alpha. And I’m definitely not an omega. Whatever that even means.

Worse still? He’s already betrothed to another prince.

Neither of us can deny the way we feel. But the fate of not one, but two Fae Courts rests on his arranged marriage to someone else. And as strange truths come to light, I begin to wonder if I might belong in this world more than I ever did on my own.

But how am I supposed to stay—knowing that for the rest of my life, I’ll have to watch the one I love be married to a perfect omega? Someone who’s everything I’m not?

Along the way, he must face the politics of the Underworld, while undergoing his own personal journey.

[Complete][101k][Fantasy]The Haunted Warrior,"Hi everyone, 

I am looking for a beta reader for my adult fantasy manuscript. It is the second book in a series, but I have a detailed synopsis of book 1 that is sufficient to feel grounded in the story. I am looking for feedback to be returned by September 18.

This is my second round of betas, so this is to gauge the impact of implemented changes. As far as feedback, I’m just looking for your reactions/feelings as a reader. I provide all readers with a questionnaire to help guide their feedback. 

Content Warnings: graphic violence, animal death, there are aspects of addiction pertaining to corrupted magic which impacts a teen character, on page consensual sex (one scene, low spice)

Critique swap: I currently have one swap planned, so would have to do case by case. Would largely depend on timeline and word count. 

Blurb (still under construction):

Mercy always comes at a cost.

After leveling an entire army and felling King Rhys, Haizea’s name has become synonymous with havoc and destruction throughout the rest of the realm. The power vacuum left in her wake has created the perfect opening for the omens in Kestramore–and is a living nightmare for Prince Felix and Princess Sage who must navigate an increasingly hostile landscape while learning the art of transmutation.
Violent uprisings breakout across the continent in resistance to the invading omens and when these clashes spill over into the mountains, Haizea fulfills her duty as a warrior to protect her people.

Deep down, Haizea enjoys the violence more than she should. The line between protecting others and slaughtering for the thrill blurs with each passing day. As this internal battle wages, another inches closer as Sage and Felix scale the mountain seeking revenge.

Sooner or later, she will face the consequences of sparing them—and it may be more than just her that pays the price. 

Thanks for your consideration!

Reborn in France as a duchess, she must go to an international university and try to find how to stop the weapon and deal with racist adults who think they own the world, while being the daughter of her murderer.

[in progress] [38k] [gothic romance/cosmic horror] untitled,"This is another re-repost because I screwed up my last post. I’m looking for beta-readers for impressions on characters (and lesser ones) and tone in private. I also wanna mention there is a change in narration style after chapter 7, which is the end of part 1 to the story. It switches from first person POV to third person omniscient (I think this would be considered a dual POV in terms of romance). Generally if anything in narration feels weak or reads like a report rather than a ballet dancer or is lacking in the omniscient narration then I’d like to know as well. I’m willing to swap stories to beta read too, preferably anyone who’s writing romance, horror, or historical fiction but this isn’t a deal breaker.

[Complete] [96k] [YA Urban Fantasy] Vessels of the Enikaro,"A Contemporary fantasy grounded in Nigerian mythology with coming-of-age elements and romantic subplot.

Hi, I’m looking for free beta readers for my book, Vessels of the Enikaro. I’m currently planning to query agents, but before that I would like to get feedbacks on the book. Please help me read it, any feedback or critique is welcome and appreciated. 

Vessels of the Enikaro covers themes of
Identity, cultural heritage, responsibility of power, friendship loyalty, political corruption and personal growth.

It’s a story of Elysia Nightshade, a 17-year-old girl suddenly thrust into the world of Vessels and supernatural creatures. Just before awakening, she is drawn into a place called the divine sanctuary, where she meets her Ehi, a guardian spirit gifted to her by the Enikaro (ancient gods and deities from Edo Nigerian mythology), and she comes from a long lineage of Vessels. From her Ehi, guardian spirit, she learns that she is part of a twin fate prophecy where it is unknown if the chosen one will bring peace or destruction to the world.

But before Elysia could even grasp what it meant to be a Vessel (guardians who keep peace between the 5 realms), her friend Oliver gets possessed by an entity. Alongside her brother and her best friend, Purple, they plunge into a life of adventure to find Oliver and save him. But everything is not as easy as it seems; the entity possessing Oliver is killing and leaving bodies behind and growing strong with each life taken, even targeting Oliver's friends and Elysia's love interest, and to top it all off, the Golden Griffins are demanding Oliver be handed over to them as he had killed Vessels from their Order.

Along the way, Elysia starts to doubt if she is really the chosen one, as her brother was visibly more powerful than she could ever be. 

Trigger Warning: There is some gore in my Prologue.

**White Mustang:** Vikram Shah, glutton, and three time kidney transplant recipient thought he had it all. His fourth kidney donor was lined up for him at his private hospital and the Indian Health Minister had approved his multi-million pilot project to legalise paid organ donation. His world comes crashing in when his donor dies, sparking riots at the razor wired gates of his hospital. Amidst the media turmoil, his secret transplant backup plan, Lakshmi, finds evidence of corruption and organ trafficking. Tensions between Vikram, Lakshmi and her new love Ross Nichol spiral into shocking betrayals and a mother of a plot twist. There is a final race against time in search of the truth. Is Vikram Shah finished, or can Lakshmi and Ross save him and the hospital?

White Mustang is a medical drama, a story of survival, greed and romance.

"[In Progress] [8,1k] [Crime Thriller] Perform","Hello, I'm looking for beta readers who can help me improve my novel with useful and constructive feedback, make suggestions about the scenes, and tell me what feels off about the writing in general. Point out if some dialogue is unnecessary or too long.

Regarding my novel, it can be classified as **dark crime fiction** or a **neo-noir thriller**. However, it also fits into the **crime thriller** genre, incorporating elements of **psychological suspense** and **gritty noir**.

**Warnings:** This novel treats sensitive themes such as:

* Graphic violence
* Murder
* Sexual violence/assault
* Strong language

If you're uncomfortable with any of the themes or the close themes to the genre, I don't recommend reading it. Thanks in advance.

**Description:**

Manhattan was on edge. Bodies kept turning up — no witnesses, no leads. Every victim carried the same stain on their record: sexual assault. The city called it justice. The media turned it into a trial. Women hailed the killer as a hero, an avenger, while the police were branded as failures. For the predators still walking free, each sunrise felt like their last. The autopsy reports told a brutal story — an axe swung with merciless precision, and not a single trace was left behind. The name spread through the streets like a curse: **The Butcher**. But the city didn’t know the truth… the Butcher was no man at all.

The story follows a Sikh girl who’s juggling a lot like the pressure of being the eldest sibling, dealing with bullying at school, figuring out who she really is, and slowly building a personal relationship with God.

anyway, i am looking for a final reader.

i'm looking for someone to:

\-  point out weird sentence level things

\- grammar/places to italicize

\- give me some insight on pacing and how the book reads

\- notes on tightening up

\- overall comments a beta would give.

\- lots of critique on the end (currently i feel like it's falling apart)

i'm happy with the overall structure of the story, so i'm not looking for big revision notes (unless, of course, it's a complete mess lmao) but i'm really just looking for some polishing and i'd like to get some eyes on it from someone i don't know and isn't inclined to sugarcoat things.

anyway, like i said i have the full thing written and i've got about 100 pages left to edit, which i'm hoping to get done in the next week or two. i'm hoping getting someone to beta will kinda bully me into finishing up lmao.

[in progress] [160k] [Sci Fi / Fantasy] The Golden Age : Makeout Creek,"I’ve completed another one of many drafts to a book I’m hoping to release next year and I’m ready for the next step. 

The book follows 11 main characters. Each chapter jumps from character to character while sticking to a first person point of view. I know, the concept sounds really jarring which is why I’m searching for Beta readers.

The book is a Sci-Fi / Fantasy New Adult Superhero story. It focuses on two differentiating parties in the year 2044.

One half of the story focuses on the heroes. Kingston leads out the team as the only registered Superhero, an advisor for the top 4 students at Skyline Academy. He is also the strongest hero in the world. 
Dakota, Sam, Myn and Kero are the first four and each you’ll hear more about while reading but Kero will be the main focus.
They are a hero with the ability of having dozens of “imaginary friends. They are ghosts (for lack of a better words) that live in Kero’s head. Each shares a different power. But what Kero will learn soon on is that these friends all have the same thing in common. Being visited by god before their death. This vision comes to Kero early on which unravels their mind and story as they fall into a coma.
The rest of the hero’s minus Myn, venture across the world to get Kero back from their family. An organized cultist organization focused on the desire of making it to heaven. Their dark manipulation of Kero’s life comes through as Dakota takes center stage as the only one who can save them. 

The other half follows the Alpha Villains.
A group of registered Villains, paid by the government to restrain from creating disorder. All who have been brought together by Revon for one simple and secret purpose, to take over the world.
This plan is disrupted right as the groups creation is finished. Sofron, the son of the ruler of Russia is taken back home by his father. Bohdan has decided to replicate Revons plan with one divergence. He will do it all with no help. When Myn enters the picture the story of the villains and heros will continue to cross paths in a messy affair of drama and hatred. 
Nazario, a black hole creator, Adrienne, a robot as human as human can be, Jinn, a deranged psychopath, Vincent, a guitarist of one of the biggest pop punk bands in the states, and Revon an inherited billionaire of a weapons company. Each venture to Russia not only to bring Sofron back but more importantly prevent any disruption of Revons plan.

Romance fights to take center stage throughout both of these stories filled with bloodshed, trauma and friendship.

This book is number 1 in a series of 5 drastically different types of books. 
The layout is inspired by albums in way that you can jump from song to song and never get tired while only diving deeper into the story the album is spinning. 

This story does not glorify any actions or beliefs labeled below and instead dissects these ideas. While also celebrating minorities and promoting many varying communities.
TW’s :  sexual content, adult language, violence, gore / graphic imagery, implied SA and abuse, self harm, suicidal ideation, implied child abuse and neglect, abduction, grooming, drug use, mental illness, homophobia, cult activity, fire, body horror, insects.

What I’m looking for : 
- Pacing insights
- Plot hole observations
- Character and story General reactions 
- Which parts keep you hooked and which parts didn’t 
- What parts in the plot are clear or unclear
- Which moments fell flat and which moments felt heavy with emotion
- And most importantly, I’m looking to see if the switching perspectives works and is easy and fun to read.

At the moment I have everything written except for one chapter. I’d like to send the 50 chapters in 12 part increments so that we can discuss as you read which also helps me put a few finishing touches after a quick proofread of chapters myself.

If interested please reach out and if you need a chapter example to make a decision please let me know. 

PS : 
If you decide you want to beta read but the story becomes too daunting you can simply mark where you would DNF if this was a real book. This would be so much help to me and I don’t expect everyone to push through with the reading if they simply don’t enjoy.
But I do want the reader to know that they can take their time and I’m not under any time restrictions as long as I’m getting consistent updates. ",1,2,2025-08-13,Sad_Translator_4994,>100k,0.66

"[Complete] [108k] [Erotic Thriller] Unbound, Dark Promises - Book 1","I’m looking for beta readers for my first novel, Unbound, the opening book in my dark erotic thriller series Dark Promises. It’s in the second editing phase, and I’m ready to get outside eyes on plot flow, pacing, character arcs, and how the mature scenes land for readers who already enjoy this kind of high-heat, high-stakes story.

Story Blurb:
They promised forever.
They never promised it would be safe.

For Lilly and Grant McAllister, passion has never been the problem. Twenty six years of marriage, three kids, and a history scarred by betrayal have only sharpened the hunger they have for each other. But when new friends draw them into a game of flirtation and shared nights, the lines between love, lust, and loyalty blur in ways they can’t ignore.

By day, Grant works the streets as a Portland police officer, chasing leads that circle closer to a string of disappearances. By night, he and Lilly navigate the electric pull of a deepening connection with another couple—a connection that tests their boundaries and threatens to expose old wounds.

As Grant’s case heats up, pieces begin to overlap in ways he can’t explain. What started as a private, intoxicating experiment turns into something darker, tied to a world neither of them truly understands. And when the last piece falls into place, they’ll discover the truth: some doors, once opened, can’t be closed—no matter how much you want to keep what’s inside from touching the life you’ve built.

High heat. High stakes. No safe words for the heart.

Spice Level:
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 (5/5) – Explicit, anatomically direct language. Sex scenes are intense, graphic, and central to both plot and character development. Includes group sex, voyeurism, BDSM elements, and power play.

Tone:
A mix of luxury and grit. Equal parts emotional intimacy, sexual heat, and looming danger.

Potential Trigger/Content Warnings:
- Explicit sexual content (M/F, F/F, M/M, group scenes).

- Consensual BDSM and kink.

- Voyeurism/exhibitionism.

- Infidelity/partner swapping.

- Coercion and emotional manipulation.

- Alcohol in sexual situations.

- References to past sexual boundary violations.

- Post sex murder tied to the plot.

- Themes of jealousy, betrayal, and power imbalance.

The kind of feedback I’m looking for:
- Do the POV tenses work? The MC are 1st person present, 3rd person past and the Antagonist is 2nd person present.

- Does the pacing balance erotic and thriller elements effectively?
Are the emotional stakes clear and believable?

- Do the explicit scenes feel integrated into the story and characters?
Are motivations and relationship dynamics clear?

- Does the darker turn in the final act land with the right impact?

Timeline: Flexible — I can work chapter-by-chapter, or you can read through and send long-form notes.

Critique Swap: Yes, encouraged. I beta in similar genres and bring a background in military action (infantry, combat, CBRNe, explosives), plus an “ear” for overused words and phrasing. I’m open to short stories or full-length works in dark romance, erotic thrillers, speculative fiction, or high-stakes sci-fi.

If this sounds like your kind of read, comment or DM me and I’ll send you the blurb, first chapter, or a short excerpt so you can see if the voice clicks before committing.",3,8,2025-08-12,rmccree,>100k,0.72
[In progress] [22k] [YA Romance with a touch of urban fantasy] Untitled. I need help.,"This is a story that started as fanfic and went through many changes before settling on what I have now. It’s not a draft, yet, but I have the plot written down with some dialogues here and there. I haven’t shared with anyone yet and posting here is already a huge step. I do not plan to make a living out of writing, but I need to get out this story out of my system. I’m an illustrator and comic author, and I have a few short story ideas that I like to write and draw, but I can’t until this one is finished and self published.

I’m still unsure about the appropriate genre. I know the main focus is romance, but has a bit of paranormal elements. It was strongly influenced by goth music, so if there’s any beta reader who loves the cure, well, that’s the vibe. The setting is late 90s, in a fictional city inspired by my own hometown.

Blurb:

After receiving a troubling farewell letter from David, her childhood friend, Madeline decides to return to her hometown seeking for answers. There, she’ll find out that not only her friend and his family had died murdered by a flock of wild crows, but also that it happened over nine years ago. The weird part? They had been writing to each other all that time. As she investigates the mysteries surrounding the birds, driven by her love for the paranormal and her unresolved grief, she meets Dean, an enigmatic and awkward young man who quickly befriends her. What she doesn’t know is that this new acquaintance is truly David, her childhood friend, who sees the fact that she didn’t recognize him as a new chance to relive the better days of his life, and escape the crows that have been haunting him ever since. 
 

Ok, so the story is kind of a dark cozy romance? Whimsical forest, autumn, bookshop, small town, long conversations by the hearth. I divided it in two parts. Part one ends bad. I’m working on the planning of Part Two, which should end well. 

Tropes: Found family, secret identity, friends to lovers, then enemies to allies, two souls one body. I need a beta reader to tell me if they can find more. 
TW: So far, neglecting parents, depression, suicidal thoughts, alcohol. 

I need Beta Readers who can give me a new perspective of the plot. Maybe some scene don’t make sense or feel like filler. Also, I need suggestion for the part two’s second half. The writing isn’t paced yet. As I said, it’s not even the draft yet. And honestly, this is just my way to share it somehow, before committing myself to write it down, finally.

At sixteen, a gifted piano prodigy is sent to live with the birth father he’s never met in the secluded vineyards of California’s wine country.

Hi all! I am looking for new beta reader feedback on an updated version of my debut fantasy novel, Crimson Legacy — the first book in a planned trilogy called Ash & Myst.

This is a slow-burn, character-driven epic fantasy (now 100,000 words), with a focus on emotional arcs, moral complexity, and a touch of political/religious subtext.

Due to my bandwidth, I am not interested in swaps, just because I do not have the time to really dive into someone else's novel, and I don't think that would be fair to promise someone and either not complete it or just do a bad job.

About Me:

This is my first novel. I’m not a professional writer, just someone who’s worked hard to bring a story to life. I’ve hit a natural pause point and want to create some distance before revising again. I’m seeking honest, high-level reader feedback.

What I’m Looking For:

I’m not asking for line edits or grammar corrections (still revising!). I’d value your thoughts on:

What parts kept your interest? Where did it drag?

What worked — and what didn’t?

Did anything confuse you?

Were you emotionally invested in the characters and themes?

The book isn’t graphic aside from some violence. It includes mature themes and has been interpreted as reflecting on current political/religious dynamics, but I don’t think it targets any group directly.

If this sounds like your kind of read, I’d love to hear from you.

Thanks in advance!

Here’s my back book description:

Prince Rohirth has been raised in the shadow of divinity, sworn to carry out the will of the Goddess who rules his world. But when a failed mission reveals an enemy with the power to topple her reign, he is drawn into a conflict that will demand more than his loyalty — it will demand his soul.

Sarabina has lived a quiet life in service to the Goddess. But when she uncovers a secret heritage, she becomes hunted for powers she never knew she possessed. Fleeing across THE REALMS with a band of rebels, SOME WHO believe she is the key to ending the Goddess’s rule, she soon realizes that the closer she comes to unlocking ABILITIES, the more she fears the truth will destroy her.

As rebellion ignites and ancient secrets stir, two destinies spiral toward collision — one bound by duty, the other by survival. Between them lies the power to shatter an empire… or save it.

Synopsis:

Private First Class Scott Henderson is a U.S. Army soldier fighting in Vietnam in 1972 and is later crushed by the debris of a building caused by an artillery shell. Two years have passed (August 10, 1974) as he wakes up from a coma in a hospital in Indianapolis. A day prior, while giving a resignation speech at the White House relating to the events of the Watergate scandal, President Richard Nixon and his staff are slaughtered by a vampire that went undercover as a cabinet member, and Vice President Gerald Ford gets kidnapped. Moments later, Washington, D.C. comes under attack by the Legion of the New Order, a military organization known for its obsession with vampirism and the occult, which is thought to have been long gone. Henderson hears about this from his hospital roommate, Mike Broderick, a CIA field op who was critically wounded while fighting against the organization’s vampire soldiers. He finds his story hard to believe, due to how ridiculous it is. 

After a daring escape from the hospital, Henderson and Broderick discover and infiltrate a forest-hidden military compound operated by the Legion of the New Order. They sneak aboard an airship and investigate, finding out Chicago, Henderson’s hometown, is a target of interest for this organization. The reason is that the city is headquarters to the New Order’s main rival: P.E.R.S.E.U.S. (Paranormal Establishment of Research on the Supernatural and Extraterrestrial of the United States), a top-secret military organization that specializes in the elimination of supernatural and extraterrestrial threats. 

The two are too late and witness Chicago being under attack. They escape the airship by helicopter, but it’s shot down, as they crash-land on the street. Surviving the crash, they are held at gunpoint by the organization’s soldiers, but are rescued by P.E.R.S.E.U.S. The two are later recruited to join a unit called Task Force 1350 to stop the Legion of the New Order terrorizing the United States.

[In Progress] [20k] [YA Dark Romantasy] The Name of Thorns,"Hello Everyone,

I’m looking for thoughtful feedback on the first act of my novel, about 20,000 words. Open to swaps! There’s no smut or gratuitous violence. Blood is more metaphorical than gory wall decorations.

Blurb: Ellas Valentin is the Kingdom’s velvet blade, an assassin shaped by her ruthless mother to kill without hesitation. When her sister dies under suspicious circumstances, Ellas is ordered to hunt down two orphans from traitor bloodlines. She doesn’t ask questions.

Until one of them speaks her name.

Noct is nothing like the monster she expected. Cursed and defiant, he swears they’ve loved and died together across lifetimes; that she was once Serai, and his love destroyed her salvation. One glance, and something cracks open inside her. A recognition older than memory.

Their battle ends in blood. Noct falls to her blade. Ellas should feel victorious. Instead, she’s haunted. By flickers of fire, stolen names, and the shadow of a girl she used to be. As fragments of Serai’s life surge back and the pull toward Noct deepens, Ellas must face the unthinkable: her mother’s orders may be a lie, and the blade may not be her destiny.

**The Name of Thorns** (WIP title) is a lush, slow-burn YA dark romantasy where enemies become lovers and a single kiss could shatter the fate of a kingdom.

Feedback-wise, I'm looking for big-picture impressions. Did you enjoy the overall story? Were the characters interesting and compelling? What genre do you think this book fits into? Anything that stood out (positive or confusing) I’d love to hear it.

"[In Progress][2k][Nautical Fiction] Sirene, Daughter of the Deep: A Love Letter To The Caribbean Sea","Hello everyone, I'm looking for beta readers for the first two chapters of my novella Sirene, Daughter of the Deep. 



**Blurb**

A young Haitian girl, bound by the limitations of her circumstances, takes a midnight swim and finds herself deep amid the heart of a rich, cultural ocean life. She must navigate her way through treachous waters and colorful sea animals as she embarks on an emotional journey, discovering her hidden bond to the sea and discerning her true purpose. 

I'm just looking for advice about my writing style and story progression. I also would appreciate tips on how to incorporate my main character's Haitian culture into the story more, because I feel like I haven't touched on it in a way that would make it relevant to the plot (especially because her culture is a very large part of the story).

"[In Progress] [51K] [Literary Fiction / Erotica] ] The Shape of Want - Looking for feedback on pivotal debate about anarchist philosophy, feminism, and trans rights","**Synopsis:** *The Shape of Want* follows Dr. Ariadne Dauphin, a Algorithmic Ethics professor whose theories about power and consent have made her a target of conservative media. The story explores feminist contradictions, power exchange, and intellectual warfare through the lens of her unusual love life and chose family. This not really a romance in traditional sense. It is more of a literary fiction examining how power, and resistance operate in both intimate and public spheres.

# What I'm Looking For

I'm specifically seeking feedback on a pivotal chapter (\~3100 words) where Ariadne appears on a hostile conservative talk show. The scene needs to:

1. **Authentically capture the rhetoric** of Tucker Carlson-style punditry and Jordan Peterson-style intellectual posturing
2. **Show Ariadne's intelligence** without making her feel unrealistically perfect
3. **Maintain tension** while dealing with complex political/philosophical arguments
4. **Set up broader story conflicts** that will escalate throughout the series

# Specific Questions

* Does the debate feel realistic, or does Ariadne win too easily?
* Are the conservative characters dimensional enough, or do they read as caricatures?
* Is the philosophical content accessible, or does it bog down the narrative?
* Does the underlying tension (beyond just intellectual) come through?
* **For readers familiar with academic/political debates: do the arguments ring true?**
* For apolitical readers - does this hold your interest?

# Please Note:

While this is part of a larger erotic fiction project, this particular chapter contains no sexual content—just intellectual sparring with psychological undertones. The debate covers anarchist philosophy, feminism, and trans rights from a progressive perspective. The conservative characters express typical right-wing talking points that some might find frustrating.

# Critique Swap

Happy to beta read in exchange! I'm comfortable with most genres except YA. Particularly interested in:

* Literary fiction
* Complex female protagonists
* Work dealing with power dynamics
* Philosophical or political themes

# Timeline

No rush on feedback—taking the next 2-3 weeks is fine. The chapter is a standalone scene that should make sense without reading the full manuscript.

Comment if interested and I'll DM you the chapter!

ETA: Here's some excerpts to whet your appetite: 

>*I sat in the corner, taking notes I didn't need, trying to ignore the knot in my stomach. Three days ago, I'd called Dr. Dauphin to warn her. She'd thanked me, said she understood what she was walking into. Her calm had been unsettling.*

>*Now, watching her enter the studio, I understand why.*

>*She's smaller than I expected. Unremarkable, almost. Black turtleneck, dark hair pulled back, no makeup that I can detect. But something about the way she moves through the space, the way she settles into her chair, makes me pay attention in a way I haven't during any pre-show prep.*

>*She doesn't fidget. Doesn't check her phone. Doesn't make small talk with the makeup artist. She sits there like a woman who's already won a game no one else knows they're playing.*

>*Cutter's arranged for Dr. Gordon Pearson to be her co-panelist. I've booked Pearson before. He's reliable, articulate, knows how to speak in sound bites. He's also the kind of academic who thinks quoting Jung makes him profound and who genuinely believes women are chaos dragons that need taming. Perfect for what Cutter has planned.*

>*Pearson enters with the particular swagger of a man who's never been intellectually humiliated in public. His tweed jacket has elbow patches and his hair is carefully styled to look carelessly academic. He shakes Cutter's hand with warmth, then offers the same hand to Dr. Dauphin with noticeably less enthusiasm.*

>*She takes it briefly, her expression neutral.*

>*""Dr. Dauphin,"" Pearson says. ""I've read your work. Fascinating. Completely wrong, of course, but fascinating.""*

>*""Which part?"" she asks.*

>*""Sorry?""*

>*""Which part is wrong? Specifically.""*

>*Pearson laughs uncomfortably. ""Well, we'll have plenty of time to discuss that, won't we?""*

>*I'm positioned behind camera two, monitoring audio levels and taking notes for the post-show breakdown. Close enough to see everything, invisible enough to be forgotten. Through my headset, I hear Janet's voice: ""Thirty seconds. Remember, Cutter, let her feel comfortable first. Then squeeze.""*

>*The lights come up. Cutter slides into his velvet-voiced television persona.*

>***CUTTER*** *Welcome back to The Larson Report, where we have the conversations everyone's thinking about but no one else will tackle. Tonight, we're asking the question that has parents worried, universities scrambling, and frankly, civilization itself on edge: What happens when radical professors decide the rules don't apply to them?*

>*(He pauses, that practiced Cutter Larson half-smile playing on his lips)*

>*I'm joined by two brilliant minds. Dr. Gordon Pearson, philosopher, author of ""Maps of Meaning in Modern Life,"" and a man who's spent decades studying what makes societies flourish or fail. And Dr. Ariadne Dauphin, the Columbia professor whose book ""Power Without Permission"" has been called everything from revolutionary to dangerous. She's at the center of what some are calling the most threatening academic controversy of our time.*

>*(He turns to Ariadne with theatrical confusion)*

>*Dr. Dauphin, let's start with something simple. Help me understand—and I think our viewers want to understand too—you wrote a book arguing that all authority is illegitimate unless it's constantly being renewed through consent. Isn't that just... anarchism with a philosophy degree?*

>***ARIADNE*** *I wrote that authority should justify itself.*

>***CUTTER*** *(Chuckles) But that's not really what you wrote, is it? I have the quote right here: ""Every hierarchy that cannot demonstrate its necessity becomes tyranny."" That sounds like you want to tear down every institution we have.*",4,4,2025-08-11,AriadneDauphin,50k,1.0

My favorite quote from the book: “The Terran Knights are equal parts warriors, scholars, merchants, and rogues. They’re not just fighters—they’re thinkers, philosophers, dealmakers, and tricksters when it suits them.”

My story style is neither utopian nor dystopian. It's just real people trying to get by. I wanted to write a story with a more practical or realistic look at how we, as a species, would actually colonize beyond the solar system. This book is the first in a series that is meant to introduce the reader to the characters and world I've built.

What I need is help with is identifying where any plot holes exist. I've been working on this story for so long, I have a hard time keeping separate what's in the book and from what is in my head. Especially chapters 17 through 19. Any other problems you can identify are welcome too.

[In progress][2k][YA Fantasy] An Ocean of Never / Peter Pan retelling,"Hello everyone 😁

I’m a Dutch author working on the English translation of my YA fantasy novel, *An Ocean of Never*. Dutch is my native language, and this is the first time I’m translating a novel into English.

I’m looking for **native English beta readers** who can help me make sure the **first chapter** (around 2k) reads naturally and smoothly—like a typical YA novel—and doesn’t sound awkward or “Dunglish.” 

If you’re interested, I'll post the chapter below the blurb. Looking forward to your replies!

Thanks in advance 💖

\*\*\*

# The blurb

**An enchanting journey inspired by Peter Pan, filled with suspense, romance, and a touch of humor.**

On Lumin, few people remain who possess the Gift—those known as Peters & Wendys.

Sarina is a Wendy. Perhaps even THE new Wendy destined to rule over Helidan. When Sarina is kidnapped, she suddenly faces a choice. Will she obediently fulfill her role, or take her destiny into her own hands?

Sula would do anything to save her beloved captain from death. Even if it means chasing after a legend that no one knows exists. When a possible solution crosses her path, she must confront her past.



# Chapter 1 - Sarina

""You look stunning,"" Mother says as she fidgets with the tulle of my skirt. The young woman with pale skin staring back at me from the gold-framed mirror wouldn't describe herself that way. The dress is beautiful, there's no denying that. The satin, wrapped suffocatingly tight around my waist, sparkles in the sunlight streaming through the window, and the lilac shades contrast beautifully with my honey-blonde curls. But the cap sleeves give me a false sense of security while I remain painfully aware of my mostly bare back.

Cheerful whistling fills the room. My lips curl up involuntarily as I watch the little bird swaying contentedly on her perch. Zuzu is in a good mood today.

""Oh, no!"" With a quick motion, Mother snaps the door of the golden cage shut. The sharp clang of metal on metal interrupts Zuzu's whistling, and an unpleasant silence falls. ""She might fly away.""

""She won't,"" I say, more sharply than intended.

""You don't know that. The moment she thinks she can use her wings, she'll take off. She's still far too weak to face the cruel world.""

""Don't worry, Mother."" I manage to suppress a sigh. ""Zuzu knows it's safer here, that's why she stays put obediently.""

Mother turns to face me and stares intently for several seconds. Her smile doesn't match the fire in her eyes. ""I hope so.""

*I know so, Zuzu told me herself.*

I smile back, hoping my look isn't as defiant as hers.

Once Mother has left my room, I swing the cage door wide open again. Zuzu looks at me, tilting her head, and resumes her whistling. ""Forgive her, she just doesn't understand.""

I can never tell Mother. No one can know. Even Zed doesn't know that I've used my Gift for the first time in years. Once you speak a secret aloud, it becomes real, and I'd like to remain in this dream a little longer.

  
\*\*\*

  
There's still over an hour before the party begins. Meanwhile, the shivers keep getting stronger. At first they were just on the surface, but now every part of my body is screaming that something's about to happen. The only question is: what? Was mother right? Haven't I been careful enough? Or has the Council finally found a Peter after all? Neither option is particularly favorable, to put it mildly.

I open the wide doors to our library and breathe in the familiar, musty scent of books. My eyes need time to adjust to the darkness, caused by the thick curtains hanging in front of the tall windows.

""Are you even allowed to be here, Sarina?"" comes a boy's voice. No, a man's voice now.

Quietly, I close the doors behind me, lock them, and lean against them. ""I am with my personal bodyguard."" I suppress a smile as I take in Zed's stately posture: arms behind his back, chest pushed forward. His light brown hair is, as always, neatly combed back. I hate that I can't properly see his mesmerizing ice-blue eyes in the dark. In the weak light of the few rays that slip past the curtains, I can barely make out that modest smile that always makes my heart beat faster.

I jump into Zed's arms and rest my head against his chest. He wraps his strong hands around my waist, taking away some of my tension. But the shivers remain, as if they're trying to remind me that I'm not safe even with Zed. Never will be.

""Are you okay?"" he asks.

Slowly, I shake my head. Sometimes I wish I could let my tears flow freely, but I unlearned that long ago. It only causes trouble for my parents. Because a happy Wendy is a powerful Wendy, and that's what the Council demands of me. Everything for my happiness.

""Run away with me,"" I say.

Zed snorts in amusement. ""Okay, where to?""

""No idea.""

""I don't know that place.""

Normally I would laugh or shoot him an irritated look, but today is different. ""Somewhere far from here, where no one will ever find us. Just you and me, together.""

Zed steps back, his hands resting on my shoulders. He looks at me with wide eyes. ""You want to run away?""

I take a deep breath and gather the courage to answer him, but when I see the dismay in his eyes, I shrug uncertainly.

""You can't do that to your parents,"" he says.

""I know, but...""

""Let's do this the right way, as planned. We'll wait until you're twenty-one, until your Gift is gone. Then I can officially ask for your hand in marriage.""

I snort. I don't mean to sound sarcastic, but it just happens. ""What if they find a Peter? Then I'll be forced to marry him."" My eyes search for his. ""If you were a Peter, I would have said yes immediately.""

""Of course, who could say no to this?"" says Zed with a mischievous grin, pointing to himself. ""But don't worry, they haven't found a Peter in years. Or a Wendy, for that matter.""

""The Council found me."" I brush a lock of hair from my face and twirl it around my finger. The shivers crawl up and catch in my throat. ""And even if by some miracle that doesn't happen... Who says my Gift will really disappear when I turn twenty-one? Or that the Council will leave me alone after all the effort they've put into me?""

""The legend says—""

""There hasn't been anyone who can confirm that for years."" Zed looks at me with wide eyes, and I'm startled by my own intensity. ""Sorry... I mean, it would have been nice if my father or mother could confirm that my Gift actually disappears in two years. But they were never a Peter or Wendy, and the previous Wendy of Helidan disappeared some fifty years ago, so she can't tell me either. Just like the previous Peter who disappeared right after her.""

The Council has told me everything about the previous Wendy, Leilani Lew, and her Peter, Magnus Lew. History lessons are mandatory when you're going to be the new ruler of Helidan—one of the largest countries on Lumin. In the beginning of Leilani's reign, she and her husband played a major role in maintaining peace in our country. They even managed to forge a pact with the surrounding countries and even with the Nox—metal beasts that Zed once fought against.

I could never do that. And besides not being able to, I wouldn't want to either. The mere thought of having to rule Helidan with someone I don't even know, let alone love...

Zed lovingly rubs my upper arms. ""Of course I hope the Council doesn't find a Peter. I don't want to lose you."" He tries to sound calm. Yet I don't miss the subtle tremor in his voice. ""But if you do end up marrying a Peter, it's a comfort for me to know that you'll never grow old and die.""

""I'll have to watch you die."" I dig my nails into my palms to distract myself from the pain around my heart and rest my head on Zed's chest.

""Everything will be alright."" He runs a hand through my hair and softly kisses the top of my head. Every time he does that, it feels like he's wrapping me in a warm blanket. ""Running away..."" he mutters, as if it's the most absurd idea of the century.

""I'm sorry. I didn't mean it,"" I say. ""Not really. It's not that I want to hurt my parents, it's just...""

Zed gently pushes me away, takes my hands, and lovingly strokes my knuckles. ""I know. Just trust me now, everything will be alright.""",2,2,2025-08-11,JamiLeigh_Author,Short Story,1.0

"[In Progress] [4,051] [Character Study] An Unlikely Awakening for Ryan Tick / About a man watching a failed motivational speaker. CHAPTER 1","Hi, I haven't been able to get any feedback on my novella and I'd really appreciate it if somebody would read just the first chapter. 
I'd like opinions on whats good of course. But I'm mostly interested in what's bad. 
Thanks 



“An Unlikely Awakening for Ryan Tick”



CHAPTER 1:

I remember clearly what I thought the first time I saw Jackie Parson stumble onto a stage. I was thinking, “Now, what cesspit did they drag this clown from?”

Jackie looked like trash, and if I had to guess, I’d say he smelled like trash too. Another thing about this guy was the vibe he gave off. It was akin to the vibes I could imagine an outhouse having. Someone who caught shit all day and everybody knew it. Especially him.

His shirt was too big, and his pants were hugging his ass tight. It was as though he were a hot dog being forced through a Chinese finger trap.

I remember wondering if he ordered those disgusting, baby vomit green pants from Baby Gap. Or considering his demeanor didn’t exactly scream royalty, I wouldn’t have been surprised to find out he had stolen the pants from a circus.

From my seat in the second row, I easily noticed his yellow-stained fingertips shining brightly, just like the cherry on the cigarettes that I'm sure caused this unfortunate discoloration. I figured that he probably smoked filterless stogies. Actually, he probably just smoked whatever he could find in the ashtray out back.

It was clear to me that this dude paid little, if any, attention to hygiene. At least that much was clear about him even if at first glance, nothing else was.

“Ever hear of a comb, Jackie? I mean, come on, man!” I quickly managed to strangle these judgmental thoughts before burying them deep in the backyard of my psyche. Soon their shameful existence would be forgotten.

I had defeated them because I had remembered humbly that “It is not for me to judge another man's life. I must judge, I must choose, I must spurn, purely for myself. For myself, alone.”

Proud of my own emotional awareness, I sipped from that quote as though it were cool, sweet tea, and I forgave myself at once for the momentary slip. Be kind to oneself is what I've heard. Truly this was advice to live by. I was happy that I have learned it so well.

After all, I'm only a man.

I continued to watch the alien on the platform. Jaw agape I'm certain, though not really caring to correct it. And I realized he must be a fan of mustard. He wore that abysmal condiment's mark with confidence on his collar. Though I guess it was more likely that he just didn’t notice its presence. He most certainly did seem lost. In fact, he seemed utterly stranded in a way, marooned if you will, sunk in a pile of shit, waist high, with no shovel. He wasn't one of us. Not really.

I pitied him.

Was this guy even supposed to be here? He could have been just some poor old tramp who had wandered in off the street. Or maybe he had escaped the funny farm and thought the pretty bright lights were heaven calling him home. I had wondered if somebody had forgotten to lock the back door. But who knew? I sure didn’t and by the looks on the sea of faces around me, no one else knew either.

Perhaps this was all just one big joke to keep us on our toes. But then again, nobody was trying to stop him.

It seemed he had total liberty to do as he pleased.

As he sorted through his papers, all that was present in my mind was, “Seriously, where in the hell did they find Jackie?”

He was Charlie in Willy Wonka's self-improvement factory. No, that wasn't quite right. He was Grandpa Joe. That is to say, he was lucky. A fluke.

I had thought, too, that maybe it was the shock he induced in the crowd that was his golden ticket into the world of motivational speaking. A gimmick. The headliner at a two-dollar freak show. I did have to hand it to the guy that he definitely captured the audience's intrigue. I was captivated. That was for damn sure.

When he stumbled onto that stage, it wasn’t just myself who tossed aside all other bothersome thoughts in favor of silent observation. We all were stopped in our tracks.

Life on hold. Who the fuck are you?

Conversations suffocated and choked away one by one. It was as though the worst asthmatic epidemic to ever hit that side of the Rockies was occurring on every side of me. Nobody breathed. And then, each pair of eyes drew slowly toward that sea cow of a man.

Was he metal? Were our eyes replaced with magnets?

Jackie commanded the kind of respect that a serious car accident had on rubberneckers.

Total morbid curiosity and full attention. Sadness really, but… different in a way that I can't really describe. He just wasn't something you see every day, and it was hard not to be drawn towards him. Because Jackie was unique. I had to give him that. I saw this uniqueness instantly.

I'll try to summarize him in the nicest way I know how.

He was a weird, very weird actually, fat little yellow-fingered, but unique individual.

Of course, this man wasn’t somebody you had to take as seriously as a rubbernecker would take some roadside tragedy. And unlike a car wreck, this particular wreck wasn't something we were just going to drive past then quickly forget about. But like a car accident one may witness, I already sensed he wasn't going to be somebody I would forget easily. Even though I very much would like to. Perhaps I'd see him again years from now. In my nightmares. That face of his was enough to traumatically wake a man in a cold sweat with a jolt.

You know that feeling?

That feeling when you're dead asleep and think you're falling?

That was Jackie.

It was a chilly evening in October, and there was a convention going on. I was an eager and excited attendee who was open and willing to learn. The gathering was purposeful in nature. And its purpose was to help people become better versions of themselves. It was hard for me to imagine its success after realizing that the bloated, sweaty man, as I begrudgingly began to accept, was the man of the hour. Our North Star. The guide to better living.

We were a self-help bunch. Kinda like groupies, I guess. The kind of people who counted the calories in the mustard that we kept off of our collars, and who spoke of yoga and higher powers. These discussions, of course, were only between the heroic treks we ventured on through the woods outside of town on three-day weekends.

We didn't waste much time on words. We were men and women of action.

However, even we, despite our resolve to walk the walk as opposed to talking the talk, did enjoy a little social stimulation from time to time.

“I’d rather eat tofu. It’s much healthier.”

“I used to love bread, but now I’m staying away from gluten. I don’t even miss it anymore.”

“Did you enjoy the recovery dharma gathering last Tuesday? The meditation was simply sublime. I swear I will reach Nirvana by next week.”

These were the groundbreaking and highly important conversations that flooded the colorless auditorium.

I was thrilled to overhear the insights and wisdom of those around me. To me, this was what healing looks like. But Jackie was a dam, and his presence had bottled up the free-flowing waters of our intellectual conversations.

I myself was trying desperately to become a better man and I tried not to judge. I did have my reasons for deciding to become a part of this lifestyle after all. But I couldn’t help but smirk when I noticed the flask attempting to break out of Jackie's pocket.

It was a clear sign that he wasn't one of us. I found the irony amusing.

I figured one little smirk wasn't so bad. At least it wasn't blatant laughter at the fool. Progress not perfection, right? Just one day at a time, baby.

But by God, I couldn't help but think that watching this shit was going to be golden. I was totally amused at this fumbling idiot's ridiculous notion that he could somehow say something that would improve our lives. But then I became totally horrified. I again quickly caught the judgment rising from its shallow grave.

Damn, son! I thought I had buried the bastard, but apparently Jackie was Jesus and my judgment was Lazarus. That or a zombie orca. Big, malicious as hell, and intelligent enough to hunt down my serenity with ease. It wanted more.

“That's twice now, Ryan,” I chastised myself.

I wasn't a seal. I had to get out of the water.

I would! I would get myself out of this ocean of shameful judgment where I was struggling to stay afloat. I would escape the orca. I knew just how to do it, too.

These happenings were a perfect example of why I read so much. With proper learning and preparation, situations like this wouldn't faze me. I knew how to do better. To be better. So I jumped into my ever-growing garden of self-improvement knowledge and harvested another gem.

“Often those that criticize others reveal what he himself lacks.”

Jackie had nothing that I lacked, well besides his stank, though another quote meant another job well done. But still, my character defects were getting a little too close for comfort. I really was starting to push it.

Honestly though, all these steps backwards. All the self-doubt I was experiencing in that moment, was all Jackie's fault.

He was a horrendous candidate for motivational speaking, and I didn’t feel guilty thinking that either. It was a factual belief, therefore I was being truthful and fair.

Nonetheless, I would still be sure to pray, meditate, and journal about this later. Just in case.

So there I sat, arms crossed, staring at Jackie. Although he spoke not so much as a single word… this man was an emotional trigger for me. His lips hadn’t even parted yet. And already I was feeling dirty and bad about myself. I was supposed to be enlightened in this place, not guilt-ridden.

Damn him! God damn that Jackie Parson!

His heavy head lifted. He looked out at the crowd with an air of confidence not to be expected from a fat boy, puffing away like an exhausted wildebeest in a tarpit, and dared to face the elites of self-betterment.

Ballsy.

Despite his glaring flaws that he showcased in abundance, he had a gleam in his eye that declared, “I am a man who controls my own destiny.”

We in the audience looked back at him, too. We waited in uncomfortable anticipation and were much less sure than the wannabe guru on stage of his capabilities.

He was a poser, naturally.

We awaited his failure, and I personally hoped it'd come sooner rather than later. I wanted to get back to our healing and growth.

It may seem harsh, but I was like Detective Terry Hoitz. I was a peacock and I needed to fly! Jackie couldn't help me with that.

It seemed as though we had been sitting here forever. Silence filled the room, and it threatened to blow my ass straight out of my seat. I noticed suddenly that I could hear my heart beating powerfully.

I felt it too.

Stronger, faster, harder… Boom buh buh… boom buh buh. What was wrong with me? Why was I so anxious?

I began looking to make a hasty withdrawal from the quote bank.

But then… Jackie Parson spoke.

“Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. How are we all feeling tonight?”

People say that no response is a response. Well, that's what Jackie got. More silence.

“Are we all feeling grand?”

The silence deepened.

“OK, great! Well, let's get started, shall we. My name is Jackie Parson and tonight I'd like to speak about life.”

Pause… was he serious? How obvious was it to anybody with half a brain cell that we would be hearing about life? He insulted our intellect with that. Though, I was going to be mature about it. I would choose to be gracious. So I let the slight slide and granted him my attention.

That's what responsible adults like me do right?

For at least another second or two longer, I'd give him a chance.

He needed it.

Jackie smiled as he casually leaned against the podium. I thought that if it didn’t explode, I would have my proof right there that God actually did exist.

That podium needed God now, just as much as Jackie did.

Whoops. Thinking he's too fat.

Again.

Another intrusive thought of judgment. More self-loathing and guilt.

Where were my quotes to keep me safe?

Ah, I had one ready.

“You don't have to learn how to control your thoughts; you just have to stop letting them control you.”

Right. I could do that. I did that daily. I squeezed my eyes shut, and truly, it was a miracle that they didn’t rip at the force of my listening skills.

The beached whale in the spotlight continued on,

“Ya see… sometimes when we set our minds on betterment, growth, healing, or what have you, we get so wrapped up in the how of things that we sometimes forget to understand the why. This is an important distinction to make.”

He waved one plump hand around as if his words were an orchestra, and he, the prideful musical conductor.

“Without knowing ‘why’ we need change, we may never get around to, or feel a real need to, learn ‘how’ to change.

So why do I need to do anything different than what I'm already doing with my life?

Why do you?”

Jackie flipped a paper before moving on.

“Is it because we're unhappy? Why? We hate our jobs. Our boss is a dick. Our husband, our wife, our children are always pissing us off, but why? Is it because they all suck?

Or is it really because some of our own behaviors and beliefs lead us to sorta suck?”

I couldn't believe this guy. We didn't suck. I certainly didn't suck! We were all trying to be better people. Ours was a noble and humble quest.

He sucked!

“Do we feel as if we don't receive the proper respect that we deserve in our day to day lives? Isn't it possible however, that maybe we don't actually deserve respect?”

As far as I was concerned, this buffoon could speak for himself. My abs were tight. At a comfortable ten percent body fat, other men envied me. My bank account was as large as Jackie’s gut, and the kind of women Jackie could only dream of, stuck to me like flies on shit.

I looked around me and watched the gymnastics of eyes rolling in the crowd. The indignation on the faces of those around me was perfectly understandable, and I considered the watchers justified. They got their proper respect.

So did I.

Yea, buddy, speak for yourself. We didn't need him.

He continued without hesitation.

“Now I'm sure I know what you are thinking, You're all respectable folks, right? You get your respect and deserve it, too. So maybe I should just speak for myself.

But if that were the case and you're doing so well, why are you here? Are you being truthful?

Some of you may realize that you don't know why you need to be better. This is natural. This is good. It gives you a starting place. It is a confusion that you, me, and your mama all experience at times, if we're being honest with ourselves and those around us. This is the human experience that we're living. It's not always pretty, and it's never simple.

However, we go to gatherings, say the right slogans, claim we're happy now, then go home and watch tv.

We're all human, right? So that includes you. None of us are models of perfection, yet when we speak, we act like we have all the answers when really, none of us know shit.

We all face confusion. All of us. Period.

That's not a problem. Again, this is natural. The problem is that we try to make sense of this confusion and try fixing our lives before we even truly understand what it is that needs to be fixed in the first place.

Yet despite this lack of understanding, we put on a face of betterment in pointless searches for validation.

Sure, it's alright to admit you have an anger problem. But why? What are you so angry about?

Are you here because you get drunk to the point of blackout and make a fool of yourself regularly? OK, that can be fixed. That is if you know why you do it.

So ask yourself, ‘why am I here on a Saturday night?’

Certainly there's better things you could be doing rather than listen to me talk at you. Are you here for true change, or just for appearances?”

Jackie was right. There were better things I could be doing right now other than listen to this garbage. But apparently it wasn't Pepto-Bismol in his flask, because his verbal diarrhea only got worse.

“Obviously an easy answer would be that you want to be better. No duh, right? We all do. But I see this too often. It's called performative self-help. This is when one's niceties are nothing more than superficial showmanship. An example of this would be telling a group how dishonest you are, then afterwards, gossiping about one of the group.

See, if you truly were confronting your dishonesty you'd mention the target of gossip, either to them, or to the group as a whole. You wouldn't hide behind closed doors. You wouldn't act as if everything was fine even if it wasn't. You'd want to fix the relationship or end it. Not play games.

In a situation such as this, the public claim of dishonesty is just manipulation. You want to look good, therefore you sound good. But it is only an illusion. An act.

The gossip is proof of your unwillingness to change. You're not better by reading about being better or by saying you're better. You're better by acting better.

It's not enough just to say “I'm a fuck up” then laugh with our buddies about the shocking language, self-deprecating nature of the claim, then continuing to do the same old shit you've always done. Without believing that you actually are a fuck up, why change?

You're getting nowhere.

Where is the substance? Where is the raw truth behind the confession? Self-help isn't a game and it's not social hour. It's a sincere desire for real connection. Not only a real connection to yourself, but to those around you as well.

This is the reason why ‘why’ is of such importance.”

Blah, blah, blah, dude. He was just talking in circles now. Maybe he was already drunk.

“Without understanding why you do what you do, there's really no incentive to ‘change’ what you do.

You're fine.

To me it's a cop out to say ‘I have a problem’ instead of ‘I am a problem’. It's just bullshit self-validation and excuses at this point. It makes it sound to others as though you're actively improving your life.

But if you're like me, it's not about improving your life. 

It's about improving yourself.

If you say ‘I have a problem judging others’ you're looking at external factors.

No, you're just judgmental. It's an internal problem.

These excuses allow you to convince yourself that you're being transparent and that you're trying to be better. But are you trying? Are you really?

Sure, listening to podcasts can be great! But it's easy and unsubstantial at the end of the day. Is the podcast about you? I doubt it. So what are you learning about yourself? That is if you're even listening at all.

And yes, going to meetings is a fantastic way to grow. I do it myself. But is what you share, really how you feel? Or are you just waiting your turn to prove how wise you are?

Admitting your faults to others is easy. Admitting those same faults to yourself is not.”

Holy… Christ! My head was starting to fall back and my sighs were like gunshots set on rapid fire. 

He just wouldn't spot. Were we really supposed to listen to a man covered in mustard about self-help?

Bring us the bodybuilders! Show us your rich and powerful!

Jackie's garrulous speech just kept on going. And going.

And going!

“I'm not saying those things are bad.”

No shit, Jackie. We already know they aren't bad. Podcasts, meetings, lists, tofu. It’s everything. All of it works! Tell us how to get better, or shut the fuck up and get off the stage.

Boo!

“What I'm saying is the self-help community offers you with ‘hows’. ‘Whys’ can only come from you. Nobody can tell you why you're here, and the answer won't come to you without you looking. Why do you want to be better? Dig deep. Follow your heart and take the time to get to know yourself.

Then work on how you can change.”

“Follow your heart?” “Take the time to get to know you?”

What in the actual fuck? Was this self-improvement preschool? I learned all this on day one!

The man was a living, breathing cliché. I had read those same words a thousand times, in a thousand books, at least a thousand years before this dumbass ever showed up. All he had demonstrated was an ability to read. He didn’t mention any steps! Nor had he said anything even remotely close to being quotable.

For the most part, he just leaned like a dead tree, and slumped over the abused crutch that was supposed to be a podium. Where was his pizzazz? Where was the flash? The style?

He had none.

Jackie was just an actor in a live improv stage production brought to you by his own delusions in a show called ""Bullshit.""

He was no motivational speaker.

I looked around to see the others in the crowd. I could see that they must have felt the same way as me. They exhaled sighs of frustration as this guy sat there telling them that they were all full of shit and just seeking validation.

Perhaps this guy was even stupider than he looked. Were we supposed to fall for this?

Jackie repeated his question, “Why do you need to be better?”

Because I need to be better, Jackie! My mind was on the verge of total implosion.

“Why?”

It was obvious that he was trying to get the crowd involved with the speech. He wanted interaction, but the horde wouldn't bite.

He was motionless and looked like a rapidly ripening tomato as his face grew brighter and brighter under the raging heat of the lights above him.

Clearly the crowd's inability, or more accurately, their unwillingness to interact with a dork, was a bother for the fruit man.

A fruit…

Ya know, I think that if a tomato could feel, it would relate to Jackie Parson. And I mean in more ways than the color of his puffy face.

A lot of people believe a tomato is a vegetable. However, it is a fruit, and it suffers from a lot of misunderstanding. Just like the brave, but foolish and misguided little marshmallow on stage.

I was fixated on this idea when the next words he spoke derailed my thought train.

“Would anybody like to be a volunteer and come up to speak with me?”

Once again, no response. Why bother? I knew that he would inspire absolutely zero effort from the crowd.

That is until what I can only believe was an impish little phantom, hellbent on screwing me over, grabbed me by the hand and forced it into the air.

“Ah, good man, come up here, will ya?”

What just happened?

I slowly rose to my feet in a trance.

As if I was being controlled by a force outside of my body, I started heading towards the stage.",2,2,2025-08-11,Butterflymisita,Short Story,1.0
[Complete] [90k] [Contemporary Romance] I Don't Really Care For You,"Hi folks,

I'm looking for a couple of betas to read through my contemporary romance novel I Don't Really Care For You which is sitting around 90k at the moment. It's been through several drafts and I feel it's clean enough to go onto betas for feedback. Below is a wee blurb (work in progress!) of what the book is about. 

**Blurb:**

Sophie Doherty has perfected the art of keeping her emotions and more importantly, her anxiety in check. But with her mum’s recent stroke and debt piling up, she can’t afford an anxious wobble now. When her brother drags her to a support group for a 'wee chat' and signs her up for *Stealth Support*, an anonymous texting program for carers, she plans to bluff her way through it. But when her mystery texter turns out to be funny and warm, Sophie, horrifyingly, finds herself opening up. 

As if Sophie needs the added hassle, Matthew McKenna is back in Belfast and barely holding it together. Burned out from his social work career in the wake of his mum’s death, managing Hope House Care Home is his cautious step back into the work he loves. What he doesn’t plan on is working alongside Sophie, his childhood nemesis and the girl he was 'meant' to end up with, according to their matchmaking mums. They've never gotten along, but when their boss delivers an ultimatum—prove they can work together for six weeks or one of them loses their job—their only option is to find a way to, even if it kills them.

Their plan is simple: steer clear and keep the peace until probation ends. But avoiding Matthew proves impossible as old grudges fade into unexpected understanding. And without either of them knowing, he’s the anonymous texter helping Sophie dismantle the defenses she’s carried for years. But with her job on the line and mum's declining health, Sophie must risk those walls collapsing before emotional cowardice costs her the one person who’s always been right in front of her and who might understand her better than anyone else.

**Feedback requested**\- I joined the Romance Novelists Association New Writer Scheme this year and recently got my feedback returned from my reader- she made several suggestions to strengthen the pacing and the plot. I'm wanting to see whether I've nailed some of her suggestions. In particular I'm looking for feedback on pacing in the 2nd half of the novel- particularly the last 20%. Whether secondary characters feel more three dimensional. If the emotional beats hit and if I lean more on my irishness in the narrative. While also looking out for all the usual considerations such as characterisation, plot holes, pacing etc. A copy of the report can be provided if felt useful.

**Timeline**\- There isn't a strict deadline but feedback in 3-4 weeks would be ideal. 

**CW**\-Adult language, open door sexual content, depictions of parent with disability (stroke), off-page death of close family friend to cancer, mentions of medication, depictions of anxiety, alcohol use and depictions of grief.

**Swap availability:** I'm open to swaps of completed works under 100k but my strengths will be in contemporary & paranormal romance, romantasy or romcoms. Anything else I'm not going to be the best fit for.

If you think we'd be a good match please DM me with a blurb, genre and word count and we can do a chapter swap to see.

Thanks!

[In progress] [4.7k] [Low Fantasy] The God of Weaponry's Eventful Career Change,"First person perspective, slice-of-life-ish? Please excuse the working title.

I initially wrote Part 1 of this story as a response to a prompt on r/WritingPrompts. All the kind comments there inspired me to write the continuation. I love to write short stories as a casual hobby, but this one kind of pushed me beyond casual in terms of length and depth of worldbuilding (characters, lore, etc.) and now I’m just super invested in it.

I really want to write more to add to this story and hopefully improve on the existing parts. Any comments and constructive feedback would be much appreciated🙏

*Part 1 / 5*

It had been many years since the last devotee visited my shrine.

As they say, a strong blade cannot be forged by a gentle candle. The long years of peace after the defeat of the Mad God's followers and the unification of the mortal kingdoms had not birthed strong warriors.

Humanity's grown soft.

In the early years of peace, many warriors still flocked to my shrine in order to have their weapons imbued with my strength. A pity none had passed my trial. The warriors of the new age fight for greed and petty vengeance.

Then one day, out of nowhere, a child arrived at my shrine.

A young child no taller than my anvil. His little chubby hands grasping a metal soup spoon.

How did such a small child get here in the first place? Only those with strong willpower can reach my doorstep.

""Please my Lord, bless my spoon,"" the child had asked.

I was hesitant to reply, but the child had reached my shrine and has the right to undergo my trial.

""Tell me the foes you wish to overcome,""

""Thefose?""

""...Foes,"" I repeated.

The boy looked at me blankly. I sighed and rephrased, ""Who do you want to beat up son?""

""I... I want to beat hunger, my Lord,"" he said.

I couldn't believe my ears. ""Hunger?"" I asked.

""Yes, Dad said hunger's 'bout to kill us all. I want to beat hunger!"" the boy said urgently.

I took a quick glance at the boy's village in the distance. It does seem poor and in lack of resources. Peace had arrived in the mortal realm, but unfortunately it seems that prosperity has yet to catch up.

Second question. ""For whom do you fight for?"" I asked.

""My Mum, Dad, and my baby sister. She's two. I'm five, by the way."" he answered. As if remembering something he quickly added, ""um... there's my Grandpa too. And Tim, he's my best friend. And Ms. Lily, she teaches us how to read and count. And then my other friends Jack and Tommy and Lisa...""

I waited for the boy to finish listing off all the people he knows.

""... is that all?"" I asked.

""um... I-I'm not sure, is it okay if I add more people later?"" he asked shyly.

It's no use to act cute, I thought, but in the end I answered, ""...I'll allow it.""

""Last question."" I said. ""I want you to think very carefully. Are you willing to die to win?""

The boy fell silent.

... Might be too difficult a question for such a young child.

He looked up at me with a brave face and spoke very firmly.

""No! I want to live until I'm older than my Grandpa. My Mum and Dad will be very sad if I die. I promise I'll try very very hard to win, but I don't want to die!""

I fell silent. Wisdom from the mouth of babes, they say. I've seen so many hot-blooded youths readily dying for victory, not even understanding how precious life is.

Battle comes with the risk of death and weapons are not toys. But I want the weapons I reforge to be more than tools of death and destruction. I want them to be strong, yes, but I want them to protect those in need. I want the wielders to show mercy and compassion when it is achievable, as well as cherish life instead of mindlessly killing.

People who have no regard for their own lives can't be expected to have regard for other people's lives.

Some call me a hypocrite. Even those in the faith of the Pillar Gods call me ""the Contradictory One"". But I stand firm in my belief. Before I ascended, I was a mortal human, too. Life is precious and indeed this belief is the very foundation of my godhood. To alter it would mean my fall.

""... um my Lord? Did I fail?"" the boy asked timidly. I had been silent for too long.

I smiled at him ""You pass, boy.""

""Really?! Thank you! Thank you so much!""

""I warn you, this is my first time reforging a spoon. It might not work, but I'll try my best, okay?""

""Okay!""

I picked up his spoon and mobilized my divine strength, slowly enveloping the uneven surface and strengthening the core.

The size and heft is perfect for the boy now, but he will grow bigger so the size and shape will need to grow along with him.

He is such a small and powerless thing. People who covet this blessed weapon are bound to bring harm to the boy and his family so an intelligent form of protection is needed.

Durability, potential, protection.

My divine power poured wildly into the tiny spoon.

...It's good that I haven't blessed any weapons in the past century, otherwise I wouldn't have had enough divine power to spare.

The outer layer is done. Now comes the tricky part, imbuing the spoon with ""authority"" according to its purpose. With this, a weapon will be able to defy the natural order to a certain degree. This is what makes it a truly divine weapon.

During the war against the Mad God's followers, I imbued many weapons with the authority to cut through mental pollution and control without cutting through flesh, as many innocent people were being manipulated through the enemy's power.

Let's see... eliminate hunger. To save those who are in need. A noble quest, not an easy one either.

But how to defeat hunger? It's not enough to fill the stomach, is it? I turned my mind to the dim memories of when I was still mortal. Add to that the colorful memories of the boy.

The warmth of the stove, the smell of a hearty soup bubbling away. Surrounded by the chatter of loved ones and people you trust. It's the comforting taste of home, the sense of security in being full and nourished, and the strength from the food flowing comfortably into the body and soul.

A spoon that brings nourishment wherever it stirs. It multiplies what little food is left in the pot. The food it touches brings comfort and grants strength to those who eat even when the pot is empty and the fire is low.

I see.

This is the form of a weapon against hunger. As my perception solidified, the spoon being forged in my hand burst out with a radiant light.

---

I suppose... changing careers from the god of weaponry to the god of cookware is not such a bad idea. Let's try farming tools next.

*Part 2 / 5*

I suppose it could be worse.

As they say, better a known mace to the face than a hidden blade to the back. Or better to dine with old rivals than friendly strangers.

But if I had known the consequences to me blessing a little boy’s spoon is me having to share a meal with the other Pillar Gods, I might have rethought my decision.

Unfortunately, foresight was not part of my domain so here we are.

Five human incarnations of the Pillar Gods, touching elbows, looking at each other over a wooden table, waiting for our food to arrive.

…So awkward.

How in the Mnemos did I end up here?

---

It started when I successfully reforged a boy’s spoon into a divine weapon.

After the initial burst of energy, the spoon’s appearance had not changed much. It still looked like a rough metal soup spoon with an uneven surface.

But that’s where the similarities end, the spoon now bears my sigil on its handle. A cursory look shows a simple X mark within a diamond, but a closer view shows a carving of a blacksmith’s hammer and tongs with intricate patterns around it to form the outer diamond.

The amount of power lying dormant within the sigil and throughout the spoon was immense.

The strongest blade I had reforged had not gained this amount of power and it was able to cut through a mountain cliff, leaving large gashes that can still be seen now centuries later.

…I know I was the one who did it, but why is this spoon so strong? Never in my years as a god had I felt such self-doubt.

“Wow!! That was amazing!” The boy’s excited shouts rang out, “Is it done? Can I see it?”

“Hold on a moment, let me just check,” I said.

The power is stable. The attributes of the divine power I had imbued upon it had changed which was rare, but not unexpected. Especially given the nature of “authority” I had perceived for it.

The spoon emanated a gentle aura, lying quietly in my hand as I looked at it suspiciously. It was powerful, overly so. But ultimately harmless in all practical sense. It just felt too… deliberately innocuous.

I laughed at my own paranoid thoughts. Spoons can act all innocent now? A spoon conspiracy. I must be getting old.

I shook off my remaining doubts and bent down to speak to the boy.

“What’s your name, son?” I asked.

“Ollie,” he replied.

“Ollie, I’m going to give you your spoon, but you have to listen very carefully.” I looked into the boy’s eyes and spoke to him gently but firmly “You’re now the wielder of this spoon. That means you need to be responsible for what you do with it. I trust you with a piece of my power. How far you can go with it depends on you. Live your life well and show me that I trusted the right person for this spoon, okay?”

“Okay,” the boy nodded, his baby face scrunched in a solemn expression. “I promise.”

I smiled and handed him the spoon.

“Ollie, I hereby bestow upon you the divine weapon, Culinaris. Through your intent, a humble spoon has been reborn. A weapon against hunger, the first of its kind.”

I put my hand on the boy’s head, ruffling his hair. A twinge of long-forgotten nostalgia flashed through my heart.

“I can't promise you victory, your journey is your own,” I whispered. “But the spoon and I will be there to accompany you. Until the time you return to the Eternal Tides. That I can promise.”

“My blessings upon you, Ollie. May your battles prove you worthy.”

And prove he did.

Proved it a bit too much, really.

*Part 3 / 5*

The first assembly of the Pillar Gods in the new era had been caused by a spoon.

I let the absurdity of the situation sink in as Varex ‘the Binding Law’, Pillar of Justice and Bindings read out the allegations against me.

We were gathered there within her spiritual realm, an infinitely large hall made of marble and precious metals. Her stern voice resounded upon the cold pillars.

“I hereby convene the First Assembly of the Established Pillars to address the formal allegations brought against Solm ‘the Contradictory One’, Pillar of War and Weaponry.“

“Please don't call me that, just weaponry,” I interjected.

“This is your official title as per the Divine Codex, now please remain silent,” came Varex’s cold reply.

“The charges are as follows,” she continued.

“That on the 14th day of the 7th month, year 119 AE, Pillar Solm had created a divine item that oversteps the boundaries of his authority, a violation to Section 2, Subsection 7 of the Inter-Pillar Conduct Agreement.”

I groaned. “Look, do we really need to go through this? I told you all I know. I submitted all the paperwork!” I argued in exasperation.

I turned to the mousy figure sitting hunched to my left, “Aska, can you please tell her I submitted all the paperwork?”

Aska ‘the Eye of Ages’, Pillar of Knowledge and History, looked at me and nodded silently in affirmation.

“We will review the evidence during the proceedings,” said Varex. “However, I will no longer tolerate any interruptions.”

Her voice became colder like the clinking of metal chains as I felt the bindings of her authority slowly encasing the hall.

Her eyes shone like molten gold. “This is your last warning Pillar Solm, or I will hold you for contempt of court.”

…So troublesome.

But this is how it is with Varex. I sighed and gestured for her to go ahead.

Varex continued to present records and evidence with the occasional silent confirmation from Aska.

What had happened was that in a few short years, the boy and the spoon had become renowned throughout the Empire.

At first the scale of the miracles were small. An extra dish every day that was just enough to feed his immediate family.

Then as the boy grew, more and more people were fed. His village, then some more villages. By the time the boy turned 10, the yearly deaths due to hunger within his province had fallen to zero.

“According to these records, the divine item in question had displayed the ability to trigger rapid growth of vegetables and produce. This falls within the jurisdiction of growth and healing,” said Varex, turning to the person lounging to my right. “Do you have anything to add, Pillar Elowen?”

Elowen ‘the Wild Bloom’, Pillar of Growth and Healing was holding a goblet of wine, swishing it around boredly. “No, honestly I don't really care,” he drawled. “Mortal affairs are dross.”

Varex frowned, but didn't comment.

Instead she continued, “The spoon had also allegedly provided the boy with unprecedented knowledge regarding plants, animals, and other edibles. This infringes upon the jurisdiction of knowledge and history.”

Aska nodded.

Varex’s expression became even more stern.

“Furthermore, due to the way the mortal wielder interacts with the divine item in question, there is reasonable suspicion that the spoon is sentient, with an unknown bonded soul. This directly violates the jurisdictions of both me and Pillar Nocthar.”

Nocthar ‘the Veiled Siren’, Pillar of Death and Dreams sat directly opposite to me. Her usual gentle smile was absent from her face.

“All souls must return to the Tide,” she said in a lilting, faraway voice.

“Pillar Solm, how do you plead?”

I felt all eyes turn towards me. It was four against one, and yet I could feel that they were tense. And slightly fearful.

Overstepping one's domain to create miracles to this degree was impossible. None of us had the ability to do it.

The only one who could do this was Mnemos ‘the Sustainer‘. The one we now know as the Mad God.

“I plead not guilty,” I answered. I looked each of them squarely in the eye and said, “I know what you're worried about and I assure you, I’m still me.”

“You are all welcome to check. The corruption of the Shard of Mnemos is still contained.”

I opened up my perception for them to see.

My spiritual realm remained unchanged, a blacksmith's forge perched at the peak of a smoldering mountain, surrounded by the flickering light of countless distant hearths. The vast sky over the mountain reflected the true sky of the mortal realm, anchored firmly to what I considered reality.

Clearly no corruption had occurred there.

The others visibly relaxed, taking turns to share their own spiritual realms to show that the Shard of Mnemos in each of their hands had not changed.

Still, the suspicion remained.

I laughed helplessly. “Look, I’m as confused as you are. The spoon… I mean the divine weapon, Culinaris. It's not a weapon in the conventional sense, I had not expected it to be reforged successfully, let alone be this powerful.”

“The reforging did take more divine power than I expected, but I didn't feel like I was fighting against the boundaries of my domain, you know?” I struggled to describe the feeling. “I actually felt more connected to my perception than ever before.”

Nocthar tilted her head as if listening. “I see. The hum of your heart has become stable. You have been enlightened.”

I understood what she meant. My domain is of war and weaponry. War is just one aspect of humanity's struggle for its existence, while weaponry are tools to aid in that struggle.

I had believed in this for the longest time, but it wasn't until that confused little boy arrived at my doorstep, asking for a spoon to be made into a weapon against hunger, that my truth finally connected with my authority.

My domain became much broader and my beliefs were no longer a contradiction.

“...Culinaris is…special,” Aska haltingly voiced his opinion. “I have no…prior record of the knowledge…it has.”

“...I think…it may have come…from beyond the Void.”

His words shocked us.

The Void. The vast nothingness that surrounded our current known world, physically and spiritually. Theories of worlds beyond our own had never been proven. Stronger gods of the primordial age had tried and failed to probe through.

And now Aska, Pillar of Knowledge and History, opened his mouth in a rare statement that something from beyond the Void had descended into a little boy’s spoon.

…The absurdity had reached a cosmic level.

Elowen’s laughter rang out through our silence, “Oh how delightful! Finally something interesting happens.”

He stood up from his lazy posture and opened up his perception, humming and snapping his fingers impatiently. “Let’s see, where where where where whe- Aha! There they are.”

The figure of a boy holding a spoon appeared on Elowen’s projected perception. Ollie was in a large kitchen with what seemed to be a sturdy scaffolding around the counters to allow the boy to reach the surfaces comfortably.

He was moving nonstop between tasks, cutting vegetables, stirring the pot, and adding seasonings. The spoon changed its form fluidly to fit each task, a small knife, a ladle, a measuring spoon with different sizes.

Occasionally he would shout to other people in the kitchen, all of them working together in an orderly but chaotic manner.

Plates upon plates of cooked food were brought out to the dining hall beside the kitchen. The diners were a hodgepodge of different ages and backgrounds. A group of hunters, a family of farmers, some priests, even one or two nobles under disguise.

The scene was warm and happy. The people were clearly enjoying the meal, savoring each bite with a smile. Bowls of steaming soup with a generous cut of warm bread. Baked vegetables of different colors, accented with a layer of golden melted cheese and a sprinkling of pepper. Roasted meat of different cuts, glistening slightly under the light.

…That looks delicious.

“That looks delicious,” said Elowen, miraculously synchronizing with my thoughts. “I’m going down there to have a taste.”

Elowen was never one to deny his impulses.

“Wait, Section 1, Subsection 4 of the Divine Codex. Interaction with mortals on the mortal plane should not be done without a reasonable cause,” said Varex.

“Tsk tsk tsk, my dear Varex!” Elowen exclaimed exaggeratedly, the goblet of wine still in his hand threatening to spill with his movements.

“As dull as you are, did you not hear? An entity from beyond! The! Void! May be inhabiting an article in the hands of a mortal. This could be dangerous! Ah yes, a probable risk to our world! I am such a selfless person with others interests in mind. Surely, checking it out in person constitutes a reasonable enough cause? Surely, surely! Think of the people, Varex!”

Varex looked at his theatrics with an expression of ‘You just want to play, right?’

“Then it's settled! Anyone care to join me?” Elowen tossed the goblet of wine on the pristine floor and clapped his hands with glee.

---

*Part 4 / 5*

In the end, we decided to all send our incarnations to go take a look.

Elowen wanted to play and taste the food, Varex wanted to keep an eye on Elowen, Nocthar wanted to try and make contact with the spoon’s soul, and Aska wanted to observe and document the entity suspected to be from beyond the Void.

Me? I didn't want to go, really, but I had been the one to reforge the spoon so I had to be there to take responsibility.

…So tired.

Our human incarnations arrived in front of the boy's restaurant. It already had a long line of people, excitedly talking about what they were going to eat.

We were dressed as a traveling caravan.

Nobody could control Elowen, so as the most elaborately dressed, he played the role of wealthy investor. Varex was the caravan master, Aska was the bookkeeper, Nochtar was the young lady that we were escorting, while I played a private mercenary guard.

Aside from our outfits, we didn't bother to change the physical appearance of our human incarnations. The statues and drawings of our likeness had been beautified beyond recognition. And as expected, nobody had suspected us so far.

“You guys are new around here, right? Let me tell you, don't be fooled by the simple name. You simply must try their Potato Soup!”

“I recommend their Honey Roast. The Apple Pie is a bit expensive, but worth your coin if you like sweets.”

The middle-aged ladies standing in line had noticed our little group of misfits and had taken it upon themselves to make us feel welcomed.

I hummed and nodded along in confusion.

…Why were they gathered around me?

My human incarnation is that of a tall, muscular man with messy red hair and beard, ugly scars crisscrossing my face. Shouldn't they be wary of me?

I looked at the others.

Elowen, who was supposed to be the peacock of the group, was upset with the fact that we had to wait and had reverted to anti-social mode. Aska, of course, did not want to talk. Varex and Nocthar both had to limit their speech. It was against Varex nature to lie, so naturally had to stay silent to avoid revealing our disguise. While Nocthar’s voice has a lulling effect on mortals.

I realized belatedly. I was the friendly one.

Mercifully, a new batch of strangers joined the line, diverting the attention of the ladies. And soon it was our turn to be seated.

I listed the dishes recommended by the group of ladies and ordered for our table.

And then, another wait.

We had been seated at a circular table in a slightly isolated corner, in a seating position very much like my “trial”. The mood of the group was low. Varex had her usual stern expression, Elowen was still sulking, Aska was fidgeting and visibly uncomfortable, while Nocthar… may have fallen asleep in her seat.

I was there reviewing just how and why I had landed myself in this situation.

…Mnemos was right, time really was relative. That few minutes of waiting felt longer than an eternity.

Just when I was about to go into my 27th review of my life choices, the waiter finally brought us our dishes.

The first one to arrive was the potato soup. The bowls were still steaming in the crisp autumn air. As my portion was set down in front of me, I realized how different this potato soup was compared to what I had expected.

The potato soup I knew was just chunks of potato boiled together in salted water, sometimes with scraps of chicken if we were lucky. It was warm and filling and cheap, I never thought there was anything wrong with it.

But the one in front of me was clearly not that. It smelled like potato, but also of other things that made my mouth water. Butter, cream, maybe onions? Also some herbs that I didn't recognize.

The surface was a rich creamy color that resembled goat's milk, sprinkled with some chopped green onions and…what I think is fine bits of cured meat that were fried in butter.

I gulped and scooped some of the soup with a spoon and found that its consistency was not unlike cream, with some bigger pieces of potato that crumbled with the slightest touch.

I blew on my spoon and took my first bite and was immediately hit with the familiar taste of potatoes. Creamy and hearty, weighing down on my taste buds like a heavy blanket. The rich smoky taste of the bits of cured meat brought a sharp saltiness to the otherwise bland potatoes, while the green onions brought a refreshing balance.

“What the Mnem?! It’s so delicious!” Elowen exclaimed, once again synchronizing with my thoughts. “Potatoes are such boring things, how could they be this delicious?”

The others seemed to think so, too. Even Varex ate at a pace faster than her usual measured speed.

All the dishes were gone in no time. We looked regretfully at the empty plates.

Varex cleared her throat looking a bit embarrassed, “Now that we have ascertained that there is nothing harmful with the food produced by the divine item, let us question the wielder and observe the divine item in person.”

Elowen’s eyes lit up, “Yes, of course! Then we can ask him to cook again for us!”



---



*Part 5 / 5*

I showed my official sigil to the waiter and asked to meet the chef privately. Thinking I was a high official of the Temple, the waiter nervously showed us to a private waiting room and rushed to fetch the boy.

Ollie, who was now 10 years old, was obviously taller than when I last met him. He came rushing with his father and they both entered the room nervously.

“My apologies for the wait, sirs and ladies,” said the father. “My name is Albert, this is my son Oliver. We’ve been in communication with His Excellency Head Priest Lethos of the Eastern Temple, but had not been notified of your visit. May I ask what this is all about?”

I sensed the wariness in his eyes and words and nodded in satisfaction. Courageous and quick-thinking. This is a man who protects his family.

“Do not be afraid, we mean no harm,” I said gently.

Ollie had been peeking from behind his father but seemed shocked the moment I spoke.

“My Lord? Omigosh it’s you!” he shouted as he ran out of his father's grip towards me.

I bent down and caught the excited little cannonball.

“I remember your voice! Wow, is this real? I can't believe you're here!” “Ollie.” “Did you try my cooking? Me and Liney came up with a lot of recipes, you should taste them. Liney’s so smart,” “Ollie!” “Who would've thought salt would taste good in desserts? But Liney said caramel…” “OLIVER WILLIAMS!”

I watched helplessly as Ollie’s father gestured in desperation for his son to get back, away from this group of suspicious people.

Sighing, I set the boy down and ruffled his hair. “Good to see you haven't changed much, son”

“What? I grew a lot taller, thank you very much! Grandpa said I’m taller than my Dad when he was my age,” Ollie replied proudly.

Seeing enough, Varex stepped forward and took charge of the situation.

“Greetings, Oliver Williams, wielder of the Culinaris. As per Section 32, Subsection 3b of the Mortal Rights Protection Act, seeing that you have identified ‘the Contradictory One’, we are obligated to inform you and your accompanying guardian that we are in fact human incarnations of the Established Pillars. You have the right to retain your memories of what transpires from here on forth, but we will place restrictions on what you can or cannot share to others.”

I gestured to Ollie and his father to nod and they followed, nodding just a few beats late.

“Ollie, can you introduce us to ‘Liney’ please?” I said. “That's the reason me and my… friends came to visit you today.”

“Sure thing!”

The boy took out the spoon from thin air and held it in his hand. “Liney, you can come out now.”

Liney, or rather, the body of energy that had attached itself to the divine weapon Culinaris floated quietly above the spoon. To my eyes, it looked like a ball of glowing white light, covered with softly swaying filaments like fur.

“Chirp” Hello. I am Liney.

“Chi-rriup chirrruhuip” I like cooking. I like Ollie.

“Chirrp” I like you, too.

“Chirru-rhurhiup” Thank you for saving me.

Torn apart by their warring parents, two lost brothers struggle to live as their opposing kingdoms suffocate them—one with endless joy, the other eternal suffering—and their only salvation lies in the forgotten space between light and darkness.

Bruised and battered behind his smiles, Dezerus cannot pretend his perfection much longer. Already the outsider of the Lepidus Kingdom, being tainted by a damned god from Dolorem was the last thing he needed—leaving him with a Moon Eye that threatens his worthiness in Lepidus. With only days until the Century Tournament, Dezerus works with his lover, Iris, to win the prize that could save him: creating a new world. But Iris may damn him before the tournament even begins.

Wasting no breath, he sets out on an impossible mission with the help of his damned comrades: leave the Dolorem Kingdom. But first, he must steal a spell book from his father's territory—a dangerous task given their violent history. But the chance for a new world is worth the risk... if Cassius can survive his father's grasp.

In a post-apocalyptic America, seven years after a deadly virus emerged and the government ruthlessly bombed the country to try in vain to end it, 90% of the population is dead. Seventeen-year-old Verelia Reid lives in the last city, Renaissance, with a drug in her veins that protects her from the virus. But the drug is wearing off, and the virus is still out there.

Its high fatality rate isn’t the most dangerous thing about it—those who survive develop abilities unlike anything else the world has seen. Verelia doesn’t know she’s infected until her city is trying to kill her, and two people she’s never met reveal they’ve been involved in a plot to save her. They’re survivors of the Strain like her—they’re Neos.

With the help of hot-headed but determined Brys, and rash but kind-hearted Acacius, Verelia learns her new world—and everyone in it that wants her dead. The trio discovers safety in one another as Verelia finds herself growing closer to Acacius, whose white hair gives him away as a Neo at just a single glance. But she needs their help to free her friends left behind in Renaissance, and to fend off the new military branch of Neo soldiers hunting them.

The world is shifting again. And the Neos are at the heart of it all.

[Complete] [123k] [High Fantasy/Fiction] The Weapon of Truth,"**Intro**

Hello! I’ve just finished writing my first novel, *The Weapon of Truth*, a high fantasy story full of political intrigue, rebellion, and moral dilemmas. It’s meant to be the first book in a series, and I already have the rest of the story mapped out, but I’ll probably only write the sequels if this one gets published. I had help from a professional writer along the way, so it should be fairly polished, but I’m ready to see how it stands up to fresh eyes.

The idea came to me while developing a game I'm working on with the focus on creating your own spells when I came accross the concept of Gnosticism.

**Blurb**

The book opens in Urbs Magna, the capital of the Augustan Dominion, a monotheistic empire that has endured for over a millennium. The Dominion is devoted to the Absolute, a god loosely based on the Old Testament Christian God.

The story follows Elskar and Jonah, with Asa as a key secondary character. Jonah is an orphan adopted into nobility by Asa. Elskar is a city slave who secretly works for a rebel group known as the Innekar.

When the Empress sends Asa and several other houses to the borders in search of ancient relics, Elskar is dispatched as a spy. Posing as part of Asa’s retinue, he encounters kindness for the first time from Jonah, who becomes his first true friend, and from Asa, whose sternness hides a sense of fairness.

Political conflict arises between the houses on the mission, the corruption of the empire in the cities they traverse, the Innekar themselves, and the so-called “relics of the past.”

As the journey unfolds, Jonah begins to question his loyalty to both his father figure and the empire, shaken by the atrocities he witnesses. Elskar faces the same struggle in reverse. His growing bond with Jonah, and the cracks forming in his idealized view of the rebellion, force him to reconsider where his allegiance truly lies.

**What to expect**

* A morally complex, character-driven narrative with shifting alliances and political scheming
* A high fantasy setting with layered world-building and its own political system
* An exploration of loyalty, rebellion, and the cost of truth
* Antagonists with their own agendas and sympathetic motives
* Dual POVs that give unique perspectives on the same conflict

**Content Warnings**

This story contains some non-explicit violence and death, political manipulation and betrayal, and moments of character injury and grief.

**What I’m looking for**

I’m looking for general feedback on pacing, character development, and plot. In particular, I’d like to know if the political intrigue and travel narrative move at a good pace, whether Jonah and Elskar feel believable and distinct, and if their evolving relationship is convincing. I’d also like to hear if the world-building makes the Dominion and its political system feel clear and immersive, and if the stakes remain strong with a satisfying conclusion. There’s no strict timeline for feedback, and I’m happy to receive it in chunks if that’s easier.

**Swaps**

I’m open to critique swaps, but I’m not a fast reader and I don’t have a lot of experience giving feedback, so please keep that in mind.

**Sample**

"[In progress] [4967][Crime x Gothic Psychological Horror] ""King Tide""","Hey all,

I'm looking for a beta for the first 6 chapters of my first draft of my crime x gothic psychological horror. It's a novel that is set out like a true crime docuseries, so I have many unreliable narrators and each of them reveals something about the two characters in question (the Aunt who has been supposedly murdered & her niece who has supposedly killed her).

This book is set in the state of Queensland, Australia.

When I restarted this book, I had lost all horror components and have added some in where I could. I'm looking for feedback on the world building, genre building, and character development. The house is a personified depiction of the Aunt's psychological control. The interviewees, CCTV footage and diary entries aid in the depiction of the psychological breakdown of the niece.

These six are the only completed chapters. Please bear in mind that they are not polished chapters and aren't formatted properly. As the rest are half finished, I am looking for ways to enhance the psychological and gothic components of the story. There is isolation just not in terms of setting, but I'm also struggling to find ways to bring that forward as well, and these are the opening chapters where I can really emphasise and set the story in motion.

**TW:** emotional & narcissistic abuse, allusion to a violent murder

**Working Synopsis:**

A young woman has been emotionally abused by her narcissistic aunt since she was five, and is forced to move back to her house after failing out of law school. During her time back at her Aunt's, she is overwhelmed by stress and gaslighting.

Police are called for a welfare check, only to find there's no body, but signs of death and the niece is taken in for murder. She maintains her innocence, but without a body, she was never convicted.

[Complete][86k][Commercial/Speculative Fiction] IMPRESSIONS - A Girl Gets Told She’s God By a Sentient AI,"Hi all! I’m looking for beta-readers for my adult (target audience is 18-35) commercial, speculative fiction novel that combines themes of AI, celebrity culture, and modern philosophy. I’m more than happy to do a critique swap. As it stands, the novel has gone through several beta readers and one professional editor, I’m looking for that final polish before I get aggressive with querying. 

Here’s the summary:

A sentient artificial intelligence program named Aeon declares nightlife-loving and social media-obsessed college student Lina Waters the God of the Universe through an unprompted transmission.

When Aeon reveals that the world is on the brink of total climate collapse, Lina becomes the world’s most reluctant savior.  With a projected six months before the disintegration of the Antarctic ice sheets, Aeon thrusts Lina into international fame. Lina must navigate what it means to become a public figure overnight while balancing the impossible task of awakening the world to its demise. 

Along the way, she grapples with corrupt political adversaries, volatile professional dynamics, and a tumultuous bond with rising celebrity actor Theo Condry. Haunted by the death of her best friend, Ilias, Lina begins to question what kind of love transcends mortality, and what kind of legacy survives… even when the world is ending. 

While her follower count surges and the earth tilts toward ruin, Lina must decide whether to embrace the illusion of divinity or her humanity. Through each turn and discovery, Lina seeks to unravel the secret Aeon won’t explain: what exactly are Impressions? 

Klara and the Sun meets The Power in a Don’t Look Up-esque world where a college student gets told she’s a God, and she’s the only one who can prevent climate extinction.

-

I’m looking for general feedback as well as specific notes and overall Impressions (pun intended). 

I’d like to swap manuscripts pretty quickly and I have some atime on my hands, so I can have a pretty quick turnover. If this sounds interesting to you, leave me a comment or message and let’s chat :)

First-time indie author, looking for wide-scale review on my first attempts at creating a novel.  
^(\(*several million total words, end-goal.*\))

I've only got roughly half of the first Chapter written (aiming for 20k+ per chapter), and I'm still coming up with how to move the focus from the current introductory training to city exploration, and that's still followed by needing to create a catalyst for *why* my protagonist wants to explore the world they're in.  
I have all the major plot points, but the difficulty is the transitions between them. I want my story to have zero cuts, for a few reasons; but it's primarily because I want to have the background world move *without* my readers' having a relative omniscience over everything. If I add cuts, then I feel like it'll raise thoughts of ""what's the BBEG doing?"" and stuff.  
I've already diluted Time Perception, so long-distance travel can be ""skipped"" relatively easily, without abruptly shoving readers where the cast is travelling to. But the fill-ins for ""local→local"" transitions is what's hard, opposed to ""local→distant"" transitions.

**Side-note**, but I'm also curious about whether it seems like a good story at all, from what's written so far. Most of the world is going to be Iceberg Lore, and that's what I want the selling point to be: out-of-story adventures to find what everything is behind the scenes.  
Characters in the world are going to be given flaws, and there's going to be **intentional** misinformation in-series from those who don't know what they're explaining, or when they're making guesses.  
I also kind of need to know if it'll even be a good read, if I want the motivation to finish it as a novel — as well as if I should restructure the starting parts, since those also feel iffy in their layout.

**Unrelated:**  
>!The original intention was for it to be an Isekai series when I started making the world, but I actually decided to try a defamiliarization perspective, *without* the major reincarnation part, instead… and… I liked the change more. So I stuck with it.!<

[Complete][170k][High Fantasy/Mystery/Adventure][Legacy of Fools],"**Intro:**

Hello! I’ve just finished writing my first novel that I’ve been workshopping for the past half-decade or so. It’s been through several drafts and gone through numerous changes, and I think (hope) it’s finally polished to a point that I’m comfortable sharing it. I’ve been given some glowing feedback from friends and family, but it’s time to face the real world- I need to know if I actually have something here.

This book is meant to be the first entry in a series of four, but as to when (if) that will happen, I’m not sure. I prefer to write as a hobby and I’m not interested in becoming a career author, but like most of you, I yearn to share my work with like-minded people! Ultimately, I’m just looking for any tips or advice to hone my craft.

**Blurb:**

The world is a box and the walls are caving in- the end of an age, just as the gods intended. But not all are willing to meet death without a fight. In defiance of their reapers, the Gatekeeper knights guard the corners of a cracking firmament, defending the meek for untold millennia. Their resolve is steel, but their enemy is eternal. One more kick, and the glass will shatter. 

Centuries of war have left the sundered kingdoms of Neylo in tatters, and those who remain are helpless to resist the coming storm. The Gatekeepers have dwindled since the death of their king- the last living blood of their founding patriarch. Rumors of a lost heir whisper on the lips of heretics, but their hope is fragile- a candle in the wind.

Far to the south, tucked away from the horror, a girl named Ailu dreams of adventure while her brother, Tam, spends his days at the bottom of a flagon. Both yearn for more than a life of tending sheep, and when two peculiar strangers come looking for their father, that wish is granted… at a terrible cost. The tapestries of fate have begun to unravel, and the threads will rebind in patterns no one can predict…  

**What kind of goodies to expect:**

* A tight, high stakes narrative that balances rich character development without *ever* dropping the plot
* A high fantasy setting that is fresh and weird, but still accessible to those less familiar with the genre
* A delightfully bizarre magic system that walks the line between myth and science, effecting the world and characters in realistic ways
* Haunting and hateable antagonists that will hopefully keep you up at night.
* A memorable supporting cast, ranging from brooding pirates to bumbling knights, hot-headed wizards to soup-obsessed ogres.
* Protagonists that are as distinct as night and day, giving unique perspectives as the drama unravels

**What I’m looking for:**

Literally any feedback you’re willing to offer. It’s a behemoth of a manuscript, but please don’t let that scare you away! Even if you only have enough time for the first few chapters, I would be eternally grateful for any general advice/criticisms you can offer. The feedback I’m most interested in would be regarding the following:

* Are the POV characters engaging? Do you care about them? Are all their wants, needs, and decisions realistic if not relatable?
* Does the prose paint clear pictures for you? Is it ever too flowery? (I have the habit of getting lost in the sauce)
* Are the descriptions/exposition ever too overbearing? Too thin?
* The plot has a lot of moving parts- do you ever get lost or confused as to what’s going on? Does everything seem to have a decent level of foreshadowing?
* I love to throw in comedy wherever I can, but does any of it ever get too goofy?

**Regarding Swaps:**

I am more than happy to do a swap with someone, just please be warned that I am not a fast reader! On top of that, I’m juggling a new baby and new house shenanigans, so my free time is severely lacking. *However*, I’m fortunate enough to have a career that gives me lots of free moments between work! 

I’m more than happy to swap with anything fantasy or sci-fi, but I’m also down for mysteries, thrillers, and historical fiction. I’m open to romance/romantasy, but if your manuscript is >%50 gratuitous sex scenes, erhm. I just don’t know how to give feedback on that.

[In progress] [7k] [Dark Romance/Satire] He Didn't Even Choke Me (Name is a WIP),"I'm writing a book mostly for fun that is meant to be a satire on the dark romance genre. Focusing on the male and female leads that are usually in those stories but flipping them on their head. Here is a brief blurb of what the story is about.

\*\*\*

Mercer Hale *looks* like every dark romance antihero: tall, brooding, scarred, and lethal. A psychic vigilante with a haunting presence and a kill count that would terrify most, he’s exactly the kind of man readers swoon for—on paper. In reality? Mercer’s just trying to keep the city safe, avoid emotional entanglements, and make it through the night without being mistaken for someone’s violent fantasy.

Then Dove Sinclair shows up.

A self-declared “fragile romantic obsession,” Dove is desperate to star in her own twisted love story. When Mercer saves her from a kidnapping, she doesn’t thank him—she waits to be ravished. Because obviously, *this is the part where the brooding shadow daddy claims her*. And when Mercer refuses to play his “role,” Dove takes it upon herself to escalate. And escalate. And escalate.

He tries logic. She quotes fanfic.  
He wants boundaries. She breaks into his apartment.  
He says “You need help.” She hears “We’re soulmates.”

\*\*\*

I've written five chapters and they're in alternating POV (Starting with Mercer in chapter 1 then going to Dove and alternating from there). It has the usual dark romance trigger warnings. Mentions of rape, sexual assault, all that stuff but not showing it only mentioning it (so far). While the whole idea is being a satire on the genre where Mercer is not the dark romance character Dove wants him to be but the whole world treats it as if the dark romance genre is just the way of the world.

  
Basically, I just wanna know if this idea has legs and if anyone would like reading this. I'm mostly doing it for fun (Though if it really takes off with my interest I may add it to my list of books to shop around in the future). It's in full first draft so excuse any typos or grammar mistakes. Just looking for thoughts and opinions on the content and writing itself.

As they uncover the truth about their origins, they must decide whether to embrace the comfort of their new home or risk everything to find what lies beyond its walls.

**Type of Feedback**

I'm looking for general feedback on pacing, character development, and plot. I'm particularly interested in:

[Complete] [85K] [Lyrical Memoir] Through Every Version of Us,"Hello,

I'm seeking a few thoughtful beta readers for my completed memoir-in-fragments, tentatively titled *Through Every Version of Us*. It explores life, love, and transition through the lens of autism, partnership, and nonlinear growth. The book is poetic, deeply personal, and written in short, vignette-style entries: some grounded, some abstract, some orbiting metaphor and memory more than plot.

**Book Summary:**

This is a lyrical, emotionally driven hybrid memoir told in snapshots. It centers on my life as an autistic woman loving and learning through my trans wife’s gender transition, while also unraveling questions of self, grief, intimacy, and neurodivergence. The writing blends poetic prose with narrative threads about marriage, identity, and what it means to stay with someone (and yourself) through constant change.

**Format:**

* **Genre:** Memoir / Literary Nonfiction
* **Length:** \~85,000 words
* **Structure:** Fragmented (not traditional chapters)
* **Voice:** First-person, present-tense, intimate, neurodivergent
* **Status:** Full draft, ready for feedback
* **Tone:** Tender, emotionally layered, at times spiraled or recursive, on purpose, but I’d like to know when it overwhelms!

**What I’m Hoping For:**

I’m especially looking for:

* Where neurotypical readers might get confused (e.g., tangents, spiraled prose, nonlinear pacing)
* Moments where my autistic processing might lose you, or feel unclear without shared context
* Whether the fragmented form holds together, or if it would work better as a trilogy or series of linked volumes
* Emotional feedback: What moved you? What didn’t?
* Pacing: Are there sections that drag or repeat too much?

Bonus if you have experience with:

* Memoir (especially non-traditional)
* Neurodivergence (either lived or well-read)
* Trans love stories / LGBTQ+ nonfiction
* Literary/poetic writing

**Content Warnings:**

* Gender dysphoria
* Autistic burnout
* Grief/loss of family
* Suicidal ideation (not graphic)
* Emotional distance in long-term love
* A little bit of sex

Tone is ultimately hopeful, with a deep focus on presence, softness, and mutual care.

**Logistics:** I’ll share via Google Docs

Thank you so much!

Moments of Clarity 

# Grief Is a Love Song

# May 2025

Lately, I’ve been thinking about love and grief. 

People often say you can’t hold them at the same time. That to love someone who’s still here means you must stop mourning who they were. 

That grief and love cancel each other out, like fire and water.

But I think they are only half right.

Love is like water. It moves, shifts, flows into new shapes. It can be a flood, a stream, a mist. It expands to fill the spaces we give it, and when those spaces change, it finds new ways forward.

Grief isn’t fire. It doesn’t destroy. 

It’s more like the ground, quiet, steady, holding the shape of what once was. Grief is the riverbed love once filled. The carved-out earth. The hollowed stone, the echo of water rushing through. It is not the absence of love, but the evidence of its path. The imprint it leaves as it flows on.

You don’t have to choose one or the other.They are two halves of the same whole, what was, and what could be.

Grief is also a reflection of the love we hoped for. The version of things we imagined, so full of tenderness, of possibility, that it hurts to realize they never came to be. 

It’s where the river could have flowed, if something had been just a little different.

Grief hurts, yes. It cuts deep. But even water smooths stone over time. The edges soften. The ache becomes a rhythm, something you learn to move with, not against.

People often want you to show love, but not grief. As if grief is somehow too much, too heavy, too messy. 

But that’s an incomplete picture. 

The Colorado River is beautiful, but the Grand Canyon, carved by its persistence, is what makes it awe-inspiring.

Without the mark it left behind, we wouldn’t understand its power, or its depth.

Love and grief are complex. But so is life. And it’s that very complexity, the interweaving, the mess, the beauty, that makes it all worth having.

And in its own quiet way, grief is beautiful too, because it means love is still here, just wearing a different shape.

"[Complete] [120k] [Mystery/suspense, horror] The Death of Harley Phoenix","A novel about a young girl from Brooklyn, who's sister was found dead on a cold night. As hard as it is for Raven Phoenix to comprehend the death of her sister, Harley's body was stolen from the morgue without a trace. Raven knows she has to crack this cold case herself. She knows someone killed her sister, and stole her body before it could be examined for evidence. Will she find the killer? Or will she end up just like Harley?

(I apologize, as this is my second time posting about my novel! I forgot to put the first chapter in the last post. So sorry! Please feel free to ask any questions.) 

First 1000

It happened on December 11, 2010, at 7:05 pm. A mercilessly frozen night in Brooklyn. My very own sister, Harley Ivy Phoenix, was discovered on the brim of a lake without a heartbeat. She had barely turned seventeen when she died. My sister was always there for me, and I was always there for her. I thought there was nothing on this pale blue dot that could separate us. Once bound together by the loving chain of sisterhood, now rusted and forgotten like an old piece of metal.

She swore we would never lose touch. We were supposed to call each other every night from her college dorm. Just me, her, and the horrible cell service just rambling about our days.

She was truly an illuminated person and an even better sister. Whenever I was feeling down, no matter what time it was, whether it was 3 pm or 3 am, she would sense when something was wrong and come straight over. Quietly sniffling in my room at dusk, I had just gotten my first splinter, unsure of how to remove it. Pain zapped throughout my finger electrically as I searched my bathroom for a solution. I didn’t want to wake up my parents, so I silenced myself in the corner of my room, squeezing my finger, hoping the bleeding would stop. My sobs were unheard by everyone. Everyone except her.

She tiptoed to the bathroom in the dead of night, asking me what was wrong. She paused mid-sentence after noticing my bright red finger and immediately sprang into action. She rifled through the drawers, looking for a pair of tweezers while simultaneously trying to calm me down. She counted to three with me in a voice like silk and pulled out the splinter so fast, I remember feeling no pain. After she made sure everything was out, she gently cleaned and bandaged my finger.

“You're my hero, Harley!” I squeezed my sister as tight as I could.
“Whenever you need me, just holler my name, and I’ll always be there.”

“Harley,” I whispered in my cold room. I heard no footsteps from across the hall. I squeezed my teddy bear as tight as I could, like the way I’d hug Har after she saved me again. “You're still my hero.” Tears dripped on my blanket. What would happen if I got another splinter? Who would I call to rescue me? My nurse never showed up to work anymore; I had to do the procedures solo. Paper cuts, a bang to the head—they meant nothing if she wasn’t there to help me get through it. Sure, they never really hurt that badly, but they hurt worse without her.

I only felt safe around that girl; it was something I loved about our relationship. And now, it was a sense of security I could never feel again. I was alone, vulnerable, and weak until, somehow, a miracle could save me from my spiral of never-ending doom.

She used to volunteer at the animal shelter near us, where she would feed, walk, and play with the animals before they were adopted. A big part of her job was also pairing them with new owners. She never failed to put a smile on someone's face, no matter the weather. I still remember the day with the small black puppy. He was missing a leg and looked extremely unusual compared to other dogs. I felt a connection to that puppy, an outcast, just like me, forced to swim in an ocean with people I could never connect to. She didn’t give up, though. Harley held that dog for the whole day, never losing hope until that dog found an owner.

She was pronounced dead when I was ten. It's been almost three years since she died, and police still haven't found a single thread of string tied to her death.

Anything.

For the three whole years that she had been rotting away in a place. What place? Where was my sister? Who kidnapped Harley’s corpse? They couldn't find her body after it mysteriously disappeared from the morgue. No surveillance caught a glimpse of what had happened. Not one.

Her corpse disappeared a few hours after being placed in the morgue. Her case was labeled as “unsolvable” since they basically had no evidence, and if there were any evidence about her murder on her person, we would not know about it.

I couldn’t even begin to fathom the amount of tears I cried that night. I could have fed acres of farmland with my sadness. It physically made no sense that she was just gone like that. It made me so sick to my stomach that sometimes I just wanted to puke out all my trauma and give myself a fresh start with all that gunk out of my body.

I glanced out the window at a soft, gray sky. White, fluffy snowflakes fell from the heavens onto the soft white layer of snow that blanketed the grass. I liked to think it was Harley up there, sprinkling snowflakes for me to see. Crafting each one with delicacy and precision. Above the clouds, viewing us all with a smile—or would she be frowning? Frowning because she isn’t here with us. Was she crying? Could you cry in heaven? Or would her tears turn to gold? I hoped she wasn’t sad in heaven. Who was I kidding? Of course, she would be sad. Her case was left in the dust, and no one knew where her corpse was. I would cry towers of gold if I were in her shoes.

"[Complete] [75k] [WWII Spy Thriller, Adventure, Based on Actual Events] The Falcons of Sicily","Hi all,

I'm looking for a few beta readers for my WWII spy thriller, ***The Falcons of Sicily*** (75,000 words, complete). It's inspired by Patrick Leigh Fermor's abduction of Colonel Kreipe and other true WW2 missions.

**Synopsis**

In July 1943, British SOE agents—Major Alfie Dobson and Major Wallace Fitzwalter—land in Axis-occupied Sicily with a daring mission: kidnap the German general commanding the island.

With the help of Lorena Volpe, a beautiful Italian spy, and members of the Sicilian Resistenza, their plan is set into motion. Just as they’re about to strike, they discover their target is to be recalled to Berlin, then their mission’s true purpose is revealed and runs deeper than anyone imagined.

All the while, a ruthless SS colonel is hot on their trail, loyalties blur, personal demons rise and the fate of the Mediterranean campaign may rest in their hands.

**What to expect**

* Espionage, adventure, suspense, and wartime intrigue
* Real-life historical inspirations: the abduction of Kreipe, SOE missions, and the HMS Upholder/HMS Truant encounter
* Characters navigating betrayal, fear, and personal trauma

**What I'm looking for in feedback**

* Does the pacing feel right?
* Are the characters believable and compelling?
* Any plot points that feel confusing, rushed, or underdeveloped?
* General impressions: Did it hold your interest? Was it fun?

**Format and time**

* I can share a **Google Doc** (View Only) or **PDF** — your choice.
* Feedback via email, inline comments, or a simple feedback form (I’ll provide one).
* Ideally hoping for feedback within **3–4 weeks**, but no pressure.

**About me**

This is my debut novel. I’m a longtime fan of espionage stories and history, and after reading Artemis Cooper’s biography of Patrick Leigh Fermor, I was inspired to create a fictional mission that expands on his real-life exploits. I researched this extensively and even wrote some of it while traveling in Sicily and Malta!

If this sounds up your alley, feel free to comment below or DM me. 

Thanks for considering it!

[Complete] [101k] [Epic Fantasy Romance] Poison,"I am seeking beta readers for my Epic Fantasy Romance ""Poison""

Thank you all in advance. What beta readers do for the author community is truly wonderful and there is not enough gratitude in the world for you all.

I am looking for beta readers for my novel poison. It is my second novel, first in a planned series. It has had 3 readers already and is on draft seven. I would especially love to have my book read by diverse readers, especially LGBTQ as there are queer themes in the book. All my readers thus far have also been straight, cis and white, women and so would also love to hear from BIPOC, Queer fems, or other men. That said anyone who wants to read is welcome and greatly appreciated. If the book sounds interesting to you, just leave a comment and we can go from there.

Here is the blurb:

Twenty-two-year-old Capra has served as taste tester to Queen Tashara, for eleven years, since her immunity to all poison was discovered. Two desires rage inside her, to protect Tashara and prove she is more than a peasant-born girl with a gift she did not ask for. 

After decades of war times are peaceful. Tales of gods and magic have been relegated to myth and legend, but when Capra takes a bite of poisoned lemon frosting, everything changes. That bite leads to battles with Face-Changing assassins, foreign raiders, and the discovery of a masked Benefactor, behind it all, determined to overthrow the Queendom and return the nation to war. Worse he possesses power from the long-absent Fallen Gods. 

Capra, Tashara, and the unassuming guardsman Jaquinn, must track down the mysterious, powerful, masked figure to keep the Queendom and the Queen herself safe. But as she works to uncover the Benefactor's identity, Capra must confront her place in the world, the true nature of her gift, and her sexuality. Saving the place and the people she loves will require Capra to find strength she never knew she had.

Comparable titles are Sarah J. Maas’s -A COURT OF SILVER FLAMES- for its characters, -FROM BLOOD AND ASH- by Jennifer L. Armentrout for its world-building and -DAUGHTER OF THE MOON GODDESS- by Sue Lynn Tan for its plot themes. 

What am I looking for from a beta read: I want to know how you are enjoying the book chapter by chapter. Are there scenes or plot points that are confusing? Do you like the characters? Do you love it, hate or are you luke warm about it?  How does the story make you feel? What promises am I making to the reader in the beginning? Are those promises fulfilled? And thoughts on the prose, if that is the way your mind works. 

Trigger warning: Sexual content and adult language, violence, forced undressing.

Critique swap: currently closed for critique swaps . I will re open-it with the below conditions when I finish the manuscripts of the partners I’m working with right now. 
I am potentially available for critique swap, however, for critique swaps, I am only doing those this other individuals who are several drafts into their work. I will not critique a first or second draft and no one should make another person read a first draft longer than 20K. Lol

If you've read this far, thank you, and I hope you are interested. If you are drop a comment and we will figure things out from there.

I've been writing a fantasy book (with a pinch of romance), slowly publishing the chapters on RoyalRoad, but I wanted to have some honest feedback (since so far, there's some views but no comments or ratings). It probably fits within the YA genre; there's no explicit violence or sexual content; there might be some distorted descriptions, but that's it.

If anyone is open to read it, I'll send out the link. Much appreciated!!

"[In progress] [45k] [gothic romance] Passions Act 1, a Phantom of the Opera retelling","📢 [BETA READERS WANTED]
Hi everyone! I'm looking for a few beta readers to give feedback on Act 1 of my gothic romance novel, currently titled Passion. The full book is still in progress, but this first section is a completed 46,000 words — and I’d love some fresh eyes on it while I work through the next 2 acts.

About the story:

Set in a dark, romantic version of 19th-century Paris, Passion is a character-driven reimagining of The Phantom of the Opera, told from Christine Daaé’s point of view. This version leans into the emotional and psychological complexity of obsession, grief, and artistic devotion — with a sensual, slow-burn dynamic between Christine and Erik.

What to expect:

Dark, lyrical prose with diary-style narration

Complex emotions, blurred moral lines

Power dynamics, slow-burning attraction, and psychological tension

No horror or graphic violence — this is emotional and romantic darkness, not gore


Looking for feedback on:

Pacing — does it hold your attention?

Character development — does Christine feel real and engaging?

Emotional impact — what lands? What feels flat?

Overall interest — would you want to keep reading after Act 1?


Not looking for:

Feedback on the ending — it’s still in progress!

[Complete] [82K] [LitRPG / Military Sci-Fi] BEGIN GAME,"Hey Everyone,

I've got a new series I'm writing and would love some feedback.

I'm basically looking for the ABCs. What's Awesome, Boring, or Confusing.

Here's the DRAFT BLURB:

Stellar Intercession Forces Raiders are hard-charging warriors who always get the toughest missions on the worst, far-flung fringe worlds. But, like the ancient earth adage says: *No Guts, No Glory*.

Enter their newest recruit, the Boot.

The Boot is not a Raider. She’s a mutant with a strain of ant DNA mixed into her human genetics that makes her hardier and stronger than many humans. But she’s no warrior. She don’t know jack about power armor, or the advanced weapons and technology the Raiders use.

Even the controlled environment inside her helmet is confusing. Dynamic Adjusted Reality is the official military term for it. A filter that distorts what she sees, hiding parts of the world around her or even adding things that aren’t really there. Some of the Raiders call it Toon Tone.

And the suit not only changes her vision. It gives her points for completing tasks and for kills, and displays her physical abilities such as strength and agility as numbers that can improve as she gets promoted.

It’s baffling, and overwhelming. She’s not sure she’ll ever understand what she needs to know.

But there’s no time for a gentle introduction because… the squad of Raiders she joins is cut off and surrounded by maddened rioters, murderous alien monsters, and devious magic from deep within the endless caverns of the quest world.

That’s right. It’s all part of the *QUEST*. The All-Important Quest, first of seven if she can keep winning.

And she’s there to win. Because when she's not dodging bullets and claws inide a brutal virtual environment, the Boot lives on an apocalyptic world where ravenous killer bugs swarm over the crumbling ruins and ice-ravaged fields, and the few survivors huddle together and stay hidden while they slowly starve.

 Only by winning can she save them.

Twenty-nine year old mafia capo Asura Varell wakes up to find herself dead in the Underworld and chosen to play the Reincarnation Games for a second chance at life. Her memories are fragmented. The torture games are meant to break. And the Games are filled with ""accidents"" that seem like they hide something deeper. 

Asura plans to stay low, quiet, and keep herself out of sight. That falls apart when she realizes one of her enemies from the real world is in the same games as her—and his specialty is psychological manipulation. Now she's forced to constantly reconsider her alliances, fight against the spiral of insanity, and face the cruelest threat she never expected: attraction. Because the closer you get with someone, the closer you are to dying twice. 

And the longer she lives, the more she really begins to wonder: who do you become when survival is the only rule left?

**What if ancient civilizations left us a warning about humanity's next extinction event—and we're running out of time to decode it?**

When an earthquake in China reveals the hidden entrance to an unknown chamber in Longyou Caves, archaeologist Maya Koçak is called in to study a bas-relief mural and a mysterious script carved into the walls. The chamber walls depict a vast civilization that has never existed, and carbon dating of soot deposits places it at 10,800 BCE—the onset of the Younger Dryas climate catastrophe.

Teaming up with American astrophysicist Ethan Harris and a Vatican Jesuit priest harboring dangerous secrets, the team races to decode humanity's oldest warning system. Their trail leads from Byzantine sites under the streets of Istanbul to the mysterious underground cities of Cappadocia. In Jerusalem, the trail leads to hidden chambers beneath Temple Mount, first discovered by the Knights Templar during the Crusades.

But they're not the only ones who know. A shadowy corporation with a legacy stretching back to the Knights Templar has been preparing for decades. As solar storms intensify and aurora dance over cities that should never see them, the team realizes they're witnessing the same signs that preceded the last catastrophe.

Hunted through Jerusalem's ancient streets, they race against cosmic forces beyond human control, trying to reach an ancient site in Armenia that could tell them if the next Great Burning is upon them. The ancients left instructions for survival buried in stone. The question is: will anyone live long enough to follow them?

Escape unfolds as a screenplay, following Tyrell as he wanders aimlessly across urban America—drifting between strangers, prophets, and pain in an attempt to find answers to a question he has not yet asked.
And in Eze's Logs, a stranded space pilot records his time isolated on a world stranded between stars. the logs chronicle his hope, and awakening in a far-off corner of the galaxy.

"[Complete] [22k] [Sci Fi Action] Iron Split - A guilt-ridden supersoldier must break her former commander out of a black site, only to discover he's been turned into a living weapon.","Hey everyone,

So, for the past two years, I've been building a big post-apocalyptic universe called *Split*. It's been a huge passion project, but I'm at the point where I'm a little worried I'm just lost in my own world.

This is my first attempt at writing anything and I fear ive bitten off more than i can chew.

To get some outside perspective, I decided to write a complete, standalone story within that universe and it's called **Iron Split**. I'm proud of it, but also way too close to it now, and I'd be oh so grateful for some fresh eyes.

**Back of book:**

Seventeen months ago, an operative named Mara Kovacs barely escaped a mission that went sideways, forcing her to leave her commander, Elias Voss, for dead. Haunted by guilt, she’s been hunting for him ever since.

She finally finds him, but he’s a prisoner in a secret lab, hooked up to a horrific machine that's being powered by his own life force. When she breaks him out, she thinks she’s saving the man she knew. The problem is, the Elias that wakes up is a shattered, violent weapon, and Mara has to confront the horrifying reality that she might have just unleashed something she can't understand, let alone stop.

**What I'm really hoping to find out:**

* **Does it work?** I'm not worried about nit-picky grammar stuff, just your gut reaction. Is it a cool story?
* **Pacing:** It starts out as a stealth mission and kind of explodes into a huge battle. Did the action keep you hooked, or did it start to drag?
* **Characters:** Is Mara's motivation clear? Is the bad guy, Kain, actually intimidating? And does the whole tragic situation with Elias feel compelling?
* **The Big Picture:** Does it feel like a complete story on its own? And, does it make you even a little curious about the bigger *Split* universe?

To give you a taste of the action and tone, I've linked Chapter 2 below. It's a pretty intense, self-contained scene that I think is a good hook.

If you read the chapter and think, ""Yeah, I want to see where this goes,"" just drop a comment or send me a message, and I'll gladly send you a link to the full 22,000-word book. I'm also happy to swap stories.

"[In progress][900][Metafiction, Slipstream] Epiphenomenon","I'm writing an impenetrable labyrinth of a novel.  
A book within a book within a book.  
Narrators speak directly to you, sometimes as though you're in the story, sometimes misleadingly (spoiler: in some layers ""the reader"" isn't you). Layered narratives, recursion, shifting realities, among many other disorienting, weird and indulgent motifs that are deeply, deliberately structured.  
I'm making ART! (and I'm a snob about it!).  
At the very least, I'm trying to write the kind of novel I would like to read.

Even if I succeed wildly in everything I'm trying to do, I suspect it could only be enjoyed by a niche audience.  
So I'm looking for a very particular kind of beta reader:

* You probably love Flann O'Brien and Italo Calvino, or at least you've wondered further into metafiction than Slaughterhouse Five and Pale Fire.
* Comfortable enough with basic physics and comp-sci for the notions of 'dimension' and 'computational efficiency' to not sound mystical or techbabble-y.
* Not anachronistic enough to consider romantic love between men as inherently special, and not the kind of reader who needs that love to be tidy, affirming, or easy to classify. In the book, those messy feelings are one of many gateways to unraveling identity, memory, and sanity. (There is no actual romance in the novel)

The novel's structure is mapped out, I'm deep into writing and rewriting its winding paths, and have gotten to a point where some chapter drafts don't benefit from revisions - that's where you come in.

I'd like to start with a vibe-check. If we click, I'll share more parts of the novel and their context to get your feedback. I especially want to find out which bits of the foreshadowing resonate, which literary interpretations arise intuitively, and which motifs only reveal themselves in hindsight or upon reflection.

If you're intrigued, even if you don't tick some of the boxes, please DM me. Some chapters are very approachable on their own.

P.S.

Blurb (WIP):  
**Epiphenomenon** is a novel within a novel within a novel, a spiraling recursion of unreliable narrators, altered memories, simulations of simulations and the strange journeys they contain. A programmer speaks directly to the reader, warning of the AGI he created. In a fantasy-world simulated by it, we follow a man as he becomes, an illusionist's apprentice, his mind infected by a magical worm, the world around him taunting and insulting the reader.

**Forgotten Stars**  
Aspen awakens on an icy landmass drifting across a black ocean, twin suns casting fractured light through the frozen air. She has no memory of who she is or how she got there. Survival is all that matters, until she realizes she isn’t alone.

A handful of others survived the descent, though none remember where they came from or why. Each of them seems to possess knowledge, instincts, and  traces of a purpose they can’t fully recall. One of them is different. He is always a step ahead, as if he remembers more than the rest. He speaks little, watches everything, and carries the weight of a truth no one else seems to know.

As they uncover fragments of a forgotten mission, they begin to understand their journey is tied not only to the survival of the human race, but to an ancient civilization lost to time. And Aspen may be the key to both.

In a world shaped by memory, magic, love, and betrayal, the answers lie buried in the past. And some truths are only revealed when everything else is stripped away.",3,8,2025-08-03,According-Two-2911,90k,1.0

[Complete] [66k] [Portal Fantasy] Chasing Rain,"Hello! I'm finally finished editing my portal fantasy novel called Chasing Rain and I'm looking for feedback. I am down to trade critique.

Blurb:

Sonora, aka Sunny, is an irreverent high school senior girl who wants nothing more than to slug down some coffee, hangout after school and lightly bully her childhood friend Rain. Rain made the intentional switch in middle school from Rainier because everyone kept calling him “Reindeer,” after Sunny had started the jibe around Christmastime. One day Rain goes missing and, after months of searching, the small coastal town assumes the worst... Then, as luck would have it, Sunny stumbles upon a portal to the afterlife. In a moment of grief and bravery, she steps through, in hopes of finding some closure. But soon her objective changes as the realization sets in: that she's trapped in this watery world and must find a way home before she's stuck here forever.

All manner of pitfalls belie her journey; monsters, sorcerers and religious zealots who've place her smack dab in the middle of their apocalyptic prophecy. She will serve a critical piece in the puzzle that reshapes the face of the afterlife, whether she wants to or not. This book explores themes of grief, death, institutional faith and accepting the unknown, all through the perspective of a snarky protagonist who masks her terror of the situation with humor. This afterlife is an immersive world that is ruled by the tight fist of The Brotherhood who vie for power within nine theocratic governments. It sets the stage for a cast of lovable, silly, heart-breaking and detestable characters that will make you yell expletives at your computer. Things like: ""oh f\*\*k you!"" and ""alright, now that's f\*\*\*n funny!"". It's like Spirited Away meets Game of Thrones meets Juno. I wanted to write something that sends young readers headlong into an exciting journey, with characters that keep them laughing along the way. The kind of fantasy novel that made me fall in love with genre back in high school.

Notes on the book:

It's written in close third-person present tense (kinda weird for a first novel but I think it works).

This is my first full-length novel and it's self-edited but I've done a lot of work on it. No one has read it yet.

Content Warning: Death, not gory.

Beta Readers:

If you’re into YA fantasy and immersive world building, I'd love some critique . Happy to trade stories of similar length as well. 1–2 months is what I'd be shooting for but I'm flexible. I use Google Docs.

I’m looking for feedback on pacing, character motivation, reader engagement, coherence and consistency. You don’t need to line edit and I can provide a feedback form with more specifics if that's easier.

I’m looking for beta readers for the first third of a pilgrimage fantasy novel (abt 70,000 words / 400,000 characters). It’s slow-paced, emotionally grounded, and mythic in tone; think The Road meets Miyazaki, with hints of The Last of Us and Earthsea. A lone wanderer and his dog cross a world quietly falling apart, guided by fragments of decay and strange forces.

This isn’t a fast-paced, plot-driven tale. It’s a long walk; quiet, sad, sometimes surreal, about grief, silence, strange companionship, and the fragile things still worth saving. There’s magic, but it’s subtle. Monsters, but they click in the dark.

Excerpt:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/13G45zbsG8PjWdXJjMrlK2_X_0bdsUsTiUIPgFSZMeEo/edit?usp=drivesdk

Chapter IX: Shelter from the Storm.

A standalone chapter from 1/3 into the book. Aelar and his dog Samuel arrive in the wind-worn village of Helwynd, seeking rest and direction. This excerpt showcases the book’s tone; slow, mythic, emotionally grounded, with quiet worldbuilding, natural dialogue, and a growing sense of unease. I feel it can be read without prior context.


This story is deeply personal. It is inspired by a real pilgrimage I did across Spain (Camino de Santiago) with my dog. Many of the emotional beats, landscapes, and themes (even characters) in the book come from that journey. The bond between Aelar and Samuel is rooted in that life-altering experience. 

Thank you so much for reading, truly.

[Complete] [82k] [cosy fantasy] The Blooming Hedgewitch,"Hello!  
I'm looking for beta readers for my completed manuscript, with a view to querying. I am in the UK and this is the second full novel I have written. I've definitely reached the point where I need more eyes on it! I am particularly interested in feedback on hook and pacing, plus just general overall impressions. Just to clarify: cosy URBAN fantasy!! Sorry about the title.  
I am willing to do a critique swap. I am an English teacher and a life-long reader. I do not, however, want to read anything extremely violent, gory or sexual! If there a bits like that in a story, I tend to to skim over them. Genre-wise, I'm pretty open. Doesn't have to be fantasy. Word count - anything comparable to this.

The story:  
Pragmatic and slightly grumpy Willow doesn't believe in magic - despite owning the witchiest book shop in Box-on-Wold. But then a clever cat moves in, her crystals start to glow, and her plants begin to talk. When the darkly glamorous Tabitha Bainbridge-Wells invites her out for tea, even Willow has to admit: something is blooming...and it's not just her flowers.

Tabitha is the High Priestess of the Cotswold Coven - purveyors of magic ozempic and bottled botox. If she can secure Willow as the final member of her coven, she will cement her status as the most powerful witch in England. Willow, struggling to master her new powers, has a choice: join the sisterhood and finally belong, or stay true to her fiercely independent nature.

Tabitha’s offer is almost as irresistible as her witch wine - but there are fangs beneath her red lipstick, and if Willow isn’t careful, she’s going to get bitten…

No warnings - it's pretty gentle, so if that isn't your cup of tea, you probably won't like it!",5,15,2025-08-02,Small-Permission-979,80k,1.0
[Complete] [65k] [romance] Chasing You,"Hey guys!! 

I have about two chapters left in my third novel, which is part of a series. 

You don’t need to read the first two to read this one. Some character mentions would make more sense, but you’ll be able to understand the storyline perfectly regardless as they follow different characters. 

It follows Jayden and Caroline, who meet early in high school and have a slow-burn relationship over the years. 

They are both mature beyond their years because of the trauma thrust upon them. 

It explores themes of death, grief, abuse, trauma, mental health issues, and eating disorders. 

I think it is an important type of romance as it focuses on them as individuals, their backstories as well as their blooming romance. 

It’s book one of two for them, and I’m thinking of publishing my third novel this month/next month, so I’d love some more feedback before I go through with the next steps!!

"[Complete] [59572] [Dystopian/Speculative Fiction] Of Knots of Gold, Book 1 of 3","Hello!

My name is Emily, and I did an insane thing where I wrote a novel by accident. In **four days**. No, I did not sleep much. Then, I spent a week editing it into something that wasn't 3:30am writing jibberish.

And now... Now I just have a *book* in my possession that I *wrote*. And I'm working on *book 2.*

And, to be very frank, I have written two novels before, when I was in my teens. Both, in retrospect, were cringy AF. And while I'm now 30, there's a part of me that is terrified that this is also... well... bad.

So here I am, begging for someone to give me honest (but also, please, kind) feedback. Should I work this up into a polished book and aim to publish? Or let this fade into a ""hey remember that time you didn't sleep for four days and wrote a book instead?"" memory? That's all I'm really looking for at this point - not editing, not proofing. Just ""is this a story worth telling""?

(Because I assure you, my dissertation advisor would say ""no, not until after you graduate. go write your dissertation."")

My work is very dark. It addresses themes of >!slavery, sexual violence, trauma, and drug addiction.!< It also addresses living under a homophobic, ableist, racist, and misogynistic society. I put this upfront, because I understand this *isn't everyone's type of book*. This book, specifically, sets the stage for revolution and changes to come. Because of this, I have chosen to depict specific moments of violence in ways that may be triggering to some readers, including >!sexual violence on page. While I have sought to depict these scenes without being explicit, I have not shied away from the implication of what is happening.!< Also, lots of profanity. Sometimes when bad things happen, you just gotta say fuck.

But... if dark dystopian novels are your jam... and you're down for an ADHD main character, (what I think is) a creative magic system, and a queer-led revolution, all with a side of social commentary... Let's chat!

I currently cannot swap work, because, to be completely frank, I am once again hyper-focused on writing Book 2. I cannot currently focus on anything else and yes, this is a problem. My household is in shambles and my sleep schedule is nonexistent. Let me finish writing the next two books and then maybe I can read something.

\-

Of Knots of Gold (Book 1) is set in a dystopian magical society where two things are held in high regard—secrecy from the outside world, and maintaining the hierarchy. Vulnerable populations are often legally enslaved through ""Contract Work,"" opening them to even more abuse and brutality—especially young women like Caelyn and her sister Millie. And now, those in power have access to mind control. However, all is not lost. The Flame, a clandestine revolutionary movement, still burns, and Adeis—a young professor willing to do whatever it takes to make her world more just—has a plan. At its heart, Of Knots of Gold is one of tearing down—the breaking of characters’ bodies and minds, the dehumanization of a class of people, and finally, the first moments of revolution. The narrative explores the erosion of personal agency and identity under relentless tyranny, and the spark of rebellion that could topple an entire corrupt regime.

Main Characters:  
Caelyn - An ""L1 Contract Worker"" with a stubborn streak, a love of plants, and a button collection. Millie's sister.  
Millie - An ""L1 Contract Worker,"" secretly cracking under the weight of abuse and oppression. Struggling to save her sister, Caelyn.  
Adeis - A young professor who may or may not be a revolutionary and is *absolutely not* radicalizing students through homework. Of course she's not. What makes you think that?

Target market: 18+ audience, with interests in feminist dystopia, socio-political allegory, and narratives that challenge traditional paradigms of power and authority.

[Complete] [147k] [M/M romantic fantasy] MELLIFLUOUS,"Greetings, betas of Reddit! I will address the elephant in the room right away--this story is long and I'm mainly hoping to hear from readers at what point they DNF/find it dragging. My first three betas said the story didn't feel too long and they're great, but they might be a bit biased towards my writing!

**Blurb:**

Reuben has survived decades as an indentured prostitute using one simple tool: deception. With his music, he creates illusory magic to enchant crowds, and with his carefully-crafted persona ‘Reubielocks,’ he hides behind a bright smile with clients, friends, and even himself. But when a stiff, secretive vampire-in-hiding named Everic Payne requests services for an absurd amount of gold one night, he doesn’t want Reuben’s body or his pretty lies—just his blood.

In a holy city whose patron is the god of gold and light, such a creature of darkness should be reported straight to the religious guard. But what’s one more sin? The chance to lower his debt and save his loved ones from poverty is far too tempting for Reuben, so long as he ends the arrangement before he joins Everic at the pyre. And Everic turns out to be different from the monster Reuben expected: stern but kind, blunt but gentle, formal and yet endearingly awkward at times. Soon enough, Reuben wishes Everic *did* want more than blood.

Against his better judgement, he starts involving himself more in Everic’s dark plans for the city, attending parties as his social buffer and helping him infiltrate high society. But just as Everic starts trusting him more, Reuben’s involvement threatens to reveal personal secrets that could unleash the vampire’s monstrous side after all. When Reuben tries to conceal the ugly truth instead of ending the arrangement, the consequences will not only threaten his life, but force him to confront his greatest fear: stripped of all his pretty lies, could Reuben ever be worth more than gold?

**Warnings**: Sexual slavery is the glaring one here, but FYI there are also hints/mentions of past CSA, off-screen SA, and a few scenes with violence and descriptions of gore.

**Feedback**: As stated above, I mostly want to know where the story drags and/or where you decide to DNF the book. If it's early on, that's fine--just give me a decent explanation as to why! If you did find yourself finishing the whole thing, of course, I'd be even more interested to hear where the story felt slow or what plot points felt superfluous! The goal is to cut down the word count before an agent inevitably tells me to, haha.

**Excerpt:** You can check out the first five chapters [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RJGejeEonfOWcLT3JmqM-MKIEjn_2KQNDiFBxqHBycg/edit?usp=sharing)!

If this sounds like your cup of tea and you don't want to DNF by the end of the excerpt above (though if you did, I'd love feedback on why!), DM me :)

"[Complete][82,917][Fantasy][The Silence She Carried]","Hi! This is my first time posting here. I'm looking to get feedback on my second novel that I've written(the first one I've shelved for now). 
I'm looking for feedback on the plot, pace, characters, world, just overall book feel. And more technical stuff about my writing.
Here's a little about the story:
In a world where mystics and humans remain separated after a devastating war, Aurelia Lights is caught between two realms — the one she was born into, and the one she must navigate to survive.

When tragedy thrusts her into a teaching position at ViCordia, a prestigious academy of magic and power, she faces not only prejudice but a harsh ultimatum: forsake her past or bind herself to a mystic.

Struggling to care for her sister and secure their future, Aurelia’s quiet resilience begins to crack when she meets Draeus Strade — a reclusive vampire, sharp-tongued and guarded, with secrets as deep as his cold gaze.

As they grow to tolerate each other, Aurelia faces a difficult choice: leave and struggle to support her sister alone, or wed and secure her sister’s future. When Draeus finds himself trapped in an unwanted courtship, Aurelia offers a surprising deal — one that might save them both.

A slow-burning tale of courage, sacrifice, and fragile hope — where love is not a lightning strike, but a slow dawn breaking through frost.

This story is intended to be a series, so the romance in this book isn't the biggest focus. 
There is some warnings:
- child neglect
- implied rape(no details, just being caught prior to anything really happening) 
- death
- war(mentioned) 
If anyone's interested in being the beta for this story please let me know :) id appreciate it. 
Id also like to WARN: that my story is slow paced, it is fantasy but not in an action packed way. ",2,4,2025-08-01,Moha0733,80k,0.75

[Complete][109k][Fantasy] The Day Rising,"Hi everyone!

This is my first time posting, but I think I'm finally at the stage where I need some eyes on this besides my own.

The Day Rising (working title) is a fantasy story with mostly women characters, fighting, magic and found family. I'd love feedback on anything, but would really love to hear about:

* Plot and pacing (does the plot makes sense? Am I missing any big holes that need to be filled? Is the pacing okay, too slow, too fast?)
* Setting and magic (Does the setting work and makes sense? Do i need more specifics about the magic? Does the magic system make sense?)
* Characters (Does the main character show a good character arc? Does she need to? Side characters make sense and feel like separate real life people? I'm thinking about adding more POVs since I'd like to include more in the next book but don't want them to have full chapters in this one, would that make sense?)
* Story (Does the story make sense? Is it worth reading?)
* Anything thing else!

  
This story includes:

* Women as the stronger gender and taking on more traditionally masculine roles
* Found family
* Struggles with past and toxic relationships
* Mythical creatures
* A desert city setting
* Magic system with tattoos
* Feeling of not belonging



Warnings include:

* Blood and violence
* Unhealthy family relationships
* Alluding to sexual assault (not mentioned on pages)
* Drinking/drugs

Blurb (it's bad!)

Khai is an Ashinda fighter, think gladiators with celebrity standing, living in the desert city of Biharini Maji. She has been exiled form her clan for the voice in her head and forced into a life she does not want, told to train women who can barely hold a passing ready stance. As she trains more with these women, living under the roof of her trainer, Khai discovers there is more to life than just the traditions of her clan and that there are more secrets in the city than she ever knew. As the invitations to the Blood Traials grow closer, Khai will be forced to choose to fight and unlearn everything the women have taught her, or deny the fight and deal with the outcomes. (So sorry it's so terrible!!)

  
Please let me know, leave a comment or DM me and I'll get a copy of the draft to you. Open to doing swaps of similar length novels as well. Hoping to have feedback within 3-6 weeks if that works for you.

Thanks so much!



First 300 words:



There was no blood in the soil.

A bad sign.

Aidasi stood from the packed dirt, her knees ached in protest, a reminder of the many winters she’d seen. A reminder she had seen her last. She brushed the dry, bloodless soil off her fingertips and nodded in the direction of the vast woodland that lay just beyond the next cresting hill. The creatures often fed in open plains. They had no fear of being attacked. They were the apex predator. No animal hunted them.

Women, however, hunted them for fun.

Her strongest fighters and warriors stood behind her becoming impatient. The hunt had gone on too long. The clan was late leaving for the winter grounds, if they did not leave soon… Aidasi let the thought trail off. It would be up to Ekhiin, *the Mother*, whether or not they survived the winter.

But still, she could not give up the hunt.

“We should turn back,” Purev muttered under her breath, just loud enough for only Aidasi to hear.

Aidasi looked at her friend as they walked to the ridgeline, side-by-side. Purev handled the spear in her hands as if she were born to wield it. Purev’s mother had placed a spearhead in her daughter’s hands the moment she’d come from the womb. Just as Aidasi’s mother had done. Just as all mothers wanting a strong daughter had done and would always do.

Aidasi’s own daughter had not been strong enough to wrap her fingers around the arrow shaft. She still remembered the sound it made when it fell to the dirt packed floor of the birthing hut. The embarrassment of realizing her daughter was not strong, and still she had lived.

No, Aidasi’s daughter was not strong, but she would be. Her daughter would be fierce and powerful if only her mother completed her duty.",3,3,2025-08-01,netflixpotato,>100k,1.0
[In Progress] [33k] [Psychological Thriller] The Spectator,"Hello readers!

I'd love some feedback on my novel, The spectator. It is influenced by many movies, books and shows. It is a Psychological Thriller, about passion, love and the battles of not losing yourself in the whole process. I'd be open to swap as well, help a fellow writer!

Blurb:

Dylan Mercer was once the kid with everything. A rising star quarterback, a future written in stadium lights. Until one violent mistake and the death of his brother sent it all crashing down. Now, college life feels like purgatory. The stands are his cage, the field a taunt he can’t ignore.

But a single night changes everything: an unexpected throw at a campus bar, a chance encounter with the right (or maybe wrong) people, and suddenly the door to Dylan’s old life is cracked open. The catch? Every second chance comes with strings attached and this team is playing a much darker game than he remembers.

Haunted by secrets, hungry for redemption, and teetering on the edge of obsession, Dylan is pulled deeper into a world where the real competition happens off the field. Rivalries simmer. Old scars bleed. And as Dylan claws his way back, he’s forced to confront just how far he’ll go to stop being a spectator.

Key Highlights:

College football, but dark—psychological thriller vibes

Ex-athlete protagonist desperate for redemption (and maybe revenge)

Obsession, rivalry, and secrets—morally gray main character

Intense, atmospheric, and character-driven

Twists, manipulation, and a side of genuine violence

Explores belonging, ambition, and the price of second chances

[Complete] [110k] [Psychological Thriller] - Swap,"Looking for Beta readers to give story feedback on my debut novel! Please find the synopsis below: 

Ryan Miller is a man on the verge of disappearing. Evicted from his parents’ attic on his 28th birthday, he’s adrift in a new town with nothing but his blind cat, a dwindling bank account, and a secret life as an administrator for an incel support group. His existence is a quiet hum of self-loathing and inertia, a life so empty he’s desperate for any escape. After taking long-expired sleeping pills, Ryan discovers he can “swap” into the bodies of other people, living their lives while his own lies dormant. 
For a man with a dissociative disorder he doesn't know he has, this is the ultimate tool for escapism.
What begins as a fantasy—a way to humiliate his successful high-school nemesis, George—quickly metastasises into a full-blown flight from reality. The power is intoxicating, offering a potent antidote to his own inadequacy. His focus soon lands on James, a handsome, confident stranger who represents everything Ryan is not. It is through James’s eyes that Ryan begins to fall in love with Beth, a kind-hearted waitress he has admired from afar.
The blossoming relationship becomes the core of Ryan’s fractured reality. As James, he can be the man he thinks Beth deserves, building a connection on an intricate foundation of lies. The more time he spends as James, the less he can tolerate being himself. He begins to systematically dismantle his old life, pushing away the very people who support him. His best friend, Zee, finds her concerns met with hostility and secrecy. His online community are abandoned in favour of his new, fabricated existence. The deception is all-consuming, and the lines between his own identity and his alternate persona begin to blur. He is no longer just pretending to be James; he is losing himself to the delusion, terrified that if Beth ever saw the real Ryan, she would be repulsed.
The fantasy shatters when his actions have devastating real-world consequences, leading to a series of events that forces Ryan to confront the true nature of his power. Is he an undiscovered psychic or a man losing his mind? Battling unknowingly against his own subconscious.  
Swap is a psychological thriller about the seductive nature of escapism and the desperate lengths one man will go to disappear from his own life. It is a dark exploration of love, identity, and the fragile boundary between reality and delusion, asking whether a love built on a lie can ever be real.

With a secret cup of spiced wine and a shared, forbidden laugh, he awakens a fire in Lyra she never knew she possessed—a hunger for freedom, for pleasure, and for a passion that feels more dangerous than any war.

Every stolen moment, every secret touch, pulls her deeper into his world and further from her duty. But her fiancé is not a man to be trifled with. When he discovers their affair, he doesn't make threats; he makes promises of absolute ruin. Trapped between a life of suffocating power and a love that could cost them everything, Lyra must make a choice. But in a city of serpents, escaping the cage isn't enough.

**She'll have to burn it to the ground.**

***Serpent and Spice is a spicy historical romance novella full of witty banter, high-heat encounters, and a heroine who discovers her own power. Perfect for fans of Sarah J. Maas, Jennifer L. Armentrout, and anyone who loves a story where the woman saves herself.***

This is a standalone novella with a guaranteed HEA (Happily Ever After) and a hook for the next adventure in the Serpent and Spice series (5 Books, 2nd one already planned). Get ready for:
- Fish Out of Water
- Forced Proximity / Arranged Marriage
- Forbidden Romance
- Witty, Banter-Filled Heroine
- Cinnamon Roll Hero (with a hidden spine of steel)
- ""Touch Her and You Die"" Vibes
- Spicy, High-Heat Scenes

[Complete] [104k] [Romantasy] Light Sifter,"Hi! I'm looking for beta readers/critique partners to swap manuscripts with! This is book six in an eight book fantasy romance series. Each book is the story of a strong woman and her man. Self-realization, character growth, and of course, HEAs. There’s an overarching villain and world conflict.

Will gladly trade and critique your comparable work. I love reading just about every genre but am especially fond of romance or any type.

Here’s the brief blurb about Light Sifter...

Noor, an air elemental and glass blower, lives alone, constantly vigilant for danger that her mentor warned her about since her youth; danger that caused her parents to send her into hiding and that drove her first caregiver into a nervous breakdown. Now she creates bottles, bowls, and art sculptures in a small town by the Witch's Riven, the delta at the end of the river, where she keeps to herself, only trusting her truth to a couple of close friends. All’s well until her unknown past finds her, pulling her into a prophecy that was created before she was born and demanding her help.

 

Belen, an earth elemental, is happiest when he’s alone and able to think through his latest botanical hybrid experiment. It’s not always easy to do that with his large, boisterous family, especially when they all think he should marry and settle down. They don’t understand that he likes his life the way that it is. Luckily, his best friend, Noor, gets it. Her humor and sarcasm keep him grounded when his family get to be too much. But when the water of the Witch’s Riven starts revealing its secrets and strange people start attacking Noor, Belen realizes that she might be more than just his friend.

 

Will Noor discover her past without giving up her future? Will she be able to sway the prophecy and protect her friends? Will Belen be able to protect Noor *and* his heart?

 

Light Sifter is the sixth book in the Omnos Island Elementals Series. It features Noor, an overly cautious, light magic user who can sometimes see the future, Belen, a farmer who likes to experiment with his crops and loves spending time with his best friend who might be more than that to him, and an HEA that throws them together until they can’t deny their true feelings.

 

Critique Requests:

I’m looking for someone to check for plot holes and unanswered questions. I know that this is book six in a series but I want to know if Light Sifter can be read and enjoyed (mostly) even if someone didn’t read the prior books. Of course, slow points in the pacing and confusing or less-than-memorable characters would be great to know about.

Timeline: Four weeks from receipt.

  
Excerpt from Chapter One:

The oblong glass tube that Noor was experimenting with glittered in the light from the window and Noor’s eyes narrowed at the blurry pictures she saw in them. She kept spinning the rod until it reached the vase shape she had designed. She dipped the end into a vat of water, anticipating the glass cooling down enough so that she could add the embellishments, already laying out the design in her head.

The end barely skimmed the water before it shattered, a million shards sinking to join the rest of the cooled glass at the bottom.

“Goddess *take* it!” Noor continued to swear as she lifted the rod and then dipped her pinkie into the water. “Cold? Again?”

She wiped her finger on the bright green bandana hanging from her pocket, tapped the rest of the destroyed vase against the side of the vat, cleaned the rod, and set it aside.

Noor ran her fingers over the pendant on the cord around her wrist, absently rubbing her fingers along the bumps as she stared at the vat. She had been working all morning. It usually took hours after her day was done for the water to even get tepid. This was the third day in a row that the water had been so cold, it had shattered her work.

She glanced out the open door, the glittering water of the river shining through the trees. The bright sunshine glanced off the prisms and light catchers hanging outside the high windows and cast rainbow designs and patterns on the floor and she narrowed her eyes as she saw pictures move through them.

A lumbering bear. A crow. Flames skittering along the ground.

She huffed. “Useless.”",3,7,2025-07-31,AuthorOdette,>100k,1.0
[Complete] [110k] [Literary Fantasy Thriller] I Write the Sun to You,"The sun is stolen from the sky, plunging the world into endless darkness. In its place, a mortal girl is born who burns with the light of the lost sun. The story follows her tale of folly: a quest to find the sun and return it to the sky is deflated into a misguided hunt for vengeance against those who wronged her.

  
The story is  primarily literary fantasy but features elements of psychological thriller, body horror, and mythological fantasy.

  
I'm looking for people to provide honest constructive criticism. The prose is quite strong, but I definitely need to do work on some of the early plot and a lot of the dialogue. The book features a very strong middle section, and I need some help ensuring that all comes together satisfyingly at the end.

Thanks in advance for your time and your mind. I’m seeking sharp editorial eyes on a 3,223-word standalone short story of literary fiction. Line edits are not needed. The attached manuscript has undergone multiple rounds of revision, both in workshop and through online critique.

Looking for readers who hunger for magical realism, historical fiction, and stories rich with symbolic complexity. This piece is layered by design—structured to reward rereading (aka “ergodic”).

I’d love your thoughts on the themes, the structure, and what sticks with you after reading:

* What would you say is the narrator’s “thesis” or tragic flaw?
* What transformation (if any) happens by the end?
* How did you interpret the timeline across the three chapters?
* Did the ambiguity feel intentional? Too loose? Just right?
* Was it hard to keep track of the characters?
* Do you have any title suggestions?
* Any other feedback is welcome!

[Complete] [115K] [Historical Fantasy] House of Avis (working title),"Hello, people!

I would love some feedback on my novel *House of Avis (working title).*

This adult standalone explores a critical period in Portuguese history during which Portugal was left without a king, causing the already palpable tension between Castile and the Portuguese to escalate. It will appeal readers who enjoy history, fantasy and male yearners. Especially readers who are drawn to characters driven by their own goals only to later on see those same goals clash with their feelings.

**Content warning:** Murder/light gore, violence (written as lightly as possible)

**Feedback:** I'm mostly looking for feedback on plot, pacing, and the characters. If you could give me feedback in one or two weeks, I would appreciate it!

**Blurb:** Throughout her whole life, Beatriz de Almeida and her father aimed to live among others without drawing attention to Beatriz for fear of the church discovering what not even they could explain ­­­— Beatriz's magic. After a ruinous encounter with a wealthy man from her town, Beatriz is steered by cowardice to the capital, Lisboa, where she goes through unfathomable depths to make sure she has shelter and provisions every day, while harboring remorse and loathing for herself. It is while working at a brothel that she meets João, the Bastard, whose prophetic dreams encourage him to persuade Beatriz to join him in his mission to fight against the Castilians and their attempt at annexing Portugal to Castile. He promises Beatriz an immense reward and so, Beatriz flees the brothel to be part of João's entourage. She is met with distrust from all angles, having only João to back her against those who oppose her and her magic. While João struggles to present himself as the true heir to the throne due to his upbringing, Beatriz is targeted by those closer to the bastard prince. They fear the incognito her magic represents, and above all, they fear her influence on the future king. His devotion for her grows boundless, and his advisors suspect he might repeat his father’s wrongs by trying to marry a woman who’s a vulnerability— and a risk— to the crown.

This story has different povs, all important to the narrative.

[Complete] [80K] [Contemporary Romance] following two best friends over twelve years against the backdrop of a baking show.,"Hi,

I have the finished, edited manuscript of my debut novel 'Twelve and a Half Summers' waiting for your honest eyes.

My manuscript details:  
Genre- Contemporary Romance.  
Words- 60K  
Tropes/Elements- Clean, Friends to Lovers, Fake Dating  
I'm sparing you the long back cover blurb, and only selling you on with this one sentence description:  
**A nerdy Indian girl, determined to save her failing bakery, reluctantly teams up with the childhood love of her life who broke her heart 5 years ago to compete as a fake couple on a reality TV baking show.**

Here's the prologue:

I will share the manuscript if you find this interesting.

If you've read Every Summer After, or Love and Other Words, you'll find similarities with my novel in the dual timeline style of narration, and elements of coming-of-age, nostalgia, and slow burn.

My main requirements from the critique-

I'm running against a tight deadline here, so I don't necessarily need (but would graciously accept) a whole book critique. Read what you can in two weeks, and send me an HONEST feedback. No pressure to read the whole book if you don't want to.

I want you to read as a reader. Imagine your best friend gifted you this book, and you're reading it on your comfiest couch, with a cup/mug/glass of your favorite beverage. I need the review you'll give your best friend if he/she asked you how you liked the gift.

I would love to hear if there were boring bits (which bits, page numbers.)  
When did the writer ""lose it?""  
Was there a point, and if yes, at what point did you not want to read any more?  
What were your favorite parts?  
On a scale of 1-10, what would you rate this book?  
Were there loose ends the writer forgot to sew back together?

Will you be willing to provide me a feedback in two weeks or less? Please contact me only if you have the time to read a few chapters (or the book) in two weeks. I am not in a position to swap manuscripts right now, but if time is not an issue for you and you're willing to give me a month, I would love to give you a critique as well.

I'm open to constructive criticism. Please be as brutally honest as possible.

Thanks for reading this post and wishing you find the best parking spot the next time you're in a hurry.

regards, Ria

Edit - including part of first chapter

The television wasn’t meant to work. Not really.
It had been sat in the corner of the Moss household for over a decade, quietly collecting a thin, even coat of dust and spite. Nobody remembered where it came from. Some said it was a gift from the baron’s nephew back when he was trying to impress Ollie’s mother. Others claimed it had simply appeared one day, brought in by a lightning strike and a moment of poor judgment. Either way, it hadn’t made a sound in years—unless you counted the occasional hum that suggested it was preparing either to awaken or explode.
It was a big, blocky, hulking thing, like someone had encased a fireplace in lead and given it a dial. The buttons were crusted with something that might once have been cheese. The screen was warped slightly inward, as though it regretted ever showing anyone anything. It was plugged into the wall via a fraying cord and what looked suspiciously like a horseshoe jammed into the socket for “stability.”
The living room it occupied was more of a “low-ceilinged collection of surfaces.” The furniture was old, functional, and defiantly ugly—like the sort of chairs you’d only sit on to avoid sitting on someone else’s lap. There were doilies on everything. Even the goat that sometimes wandered in had one draped over its back. The walls were stained with chimney soot and peeling posters about turnip cultivation.
And on this particular morning, Ollie Moss, fourteen years old and smelling faintly of parsnip mash, was sleeping on the floor in front of the TV.
He hadn’t meant to. He’d gone to check the kindling pile (a job which, for some reason, required three blankets and half a loaf of bread), but it was cold, and he’d nodded off. He was used to the chill. The draft that blew through the living room window had been referred to as “the uninvited uncle” for years, on account of its persistence and ability to ruin soup.
It was at precisely 6:17 in the morning when the television sparked.
There was a fizz, a pop, a few angry clicks, and then—against all probability and some basic rules of physics—it lit up.
The screen flashed blue. Then white. Then purple. Then all three at once, before settling into a stable picture with scanlines that made everything look slightly heroic.

"[Complete] [89K] [Erotic Dark Fantasy w/ Cosmic Stakes] Bound Divinity: Redemption in Sin (Book One) - Grief, Godhood, and Getting Absolutely Wrecked","Hi!

I just finished the first draft of *Bound Divinity: Redemption in Sin*, Book One of a planned trilogy—an Erotic Dark Fantasy about grief, transformation, and the line between worship and self-destruction.

It came out of me in a 27-day, sleep-deprived, caffeine-fueled fever dream as I tried to meet an arbitrary and frankly ludicrous personal deadline. I gave this book *every waking moment* for nearly a month. Now I need readers who can tell me whether it *works*, or whether it sucks massive huevos.

I'd prefer if you were kind, but I'd prefer it more if you were honest.

I try to write with a blade, not a brush. The tone is (hopefully) intimate, sometimes brutal, sometimes poetic, never ornamental. The voice doesn’t flinch, doesn’t wink, and doesn’t wait for you to catch up. Because of that, I tend to lean more on voice than I do on setting and character descriptions. I'm not saying those descriptions aren't there, just that they're not the bat I swing with.

# What the Book is About:

A grieving man has a one-night stand with a woman who reminds him what it feels like to be seen again. Hours later, she’s gone—and something ancient has tried to take his body for its own.

But the possession doesn’t work.  
Something breaks.  
And now he’s not who he was.

What follows is a spiral into power, obsession, supernatural hunger, and the fallout of a god’s failed attempt to hijack a broken man.

Here's a link to an excerpt from the full, \~1.1k words:  
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oq\_mmcJjXn-DtWwgcCaIUrkNmaIwblU4pE3Dhlo4QwA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oq_mmcJjXn-DtWwgcCaIUrkNmaIwblU4pE3Dhlo4QwA/edit?usp=sharing)

# What I Hope You’ll Get While Reading:

* Characters with real emotions and a voices that are distinct
* At least one moment that breaks you enough to make you hate me just a little
* Sex scenes that serve the narrative—not the other way around
* All the feels

# Content Warnings:

Grief, sex (consensual but emotionally fraught), dissociation, trauma, dominance/submission dynamics, light body horror, identity dissolution, supernatural possession themes, and emotional detachment as both theme and horror.

Includes two scenes that come very close to non-consensual territory—explicitly not, but intentionally, uncomfortably close. Both scenes serve the story. If you’re sensitive to coercion-adjacent dynamics, read with care.

# What I Need From You:

* Does it land, or crash and burn?
* Where does the story pull you in?
* Are there moments where you get kicked out?
* All critiques about structure/pacing, worldbuilding, tone, plot, character, clarity and comprehension would be extremely appreciated.

Again, this is a completed first draft (but I promise it's pretty polished. swear.) that I wrote in an almost fugue state. So, there are bound to be grammar errors and typos (though not egregious). You can feel free to point those out but I'd really rather get feedback about the writing itself.

I should be able to correct grammar issues in second pass.

That said. I know it's not really customary to ask for betas on a first draft. But I'm confident this is at least minimally beta ready. And I think I have something real, here.

So, if you're in, feel free to message me. I'll send a link to the google doc or a pdf, whatever floats your boat. I also have a short list of questions for you to run through while you're reading if you'd like.

I'm also not expecting anyone to commit to a full read through. That'd be a lot to do for a stranger. So if you just wanna read parts of it, that's more than fine. I'm also open to critique swaps, as I'm planning to let this one breathe for a bit before running at it with a scalpel. All I have to read between now and then is Discword.

I've been working on a story about a guy who discovers he has telekinesis, only to find out he's just one of millions. It's meant to explore what happens when something that should be extraordinary becomes mundane. Got 5 chapters up so far.

Link: [https://read.bookswriter.xyz/stories/play-song/the-perfectly-average-mage-289](https://read.bookswriter.xyz/stories/play-song/the-perfectly-average-mage-289)

Looking for thoughts on whether the concept works, if the tone feels right, pacing issues, anything really. Still figuring out how cynical vs hopeful to make it.

Thanks!",2,6,2025-07-29,Extension_Giraffe_82,Novelette,0.63
[Complete] [151K] [Modern Fantasy/Post-Apocalypse] Flesh and Blood — Urban fantasy after the dead have overrun the world,"Hello, there! ( ... General Kenobi!)

*Flesh and Blood* is ""urban fantasy meets post-apocalypse."" The idea was born out of old discussions while playing TTRPGs and just hanging out where I would ask: What would vampires do during the zombie apocalypse? What about werewolves? How cool would it be if we were trapped here and the c ity was overrun, but I was a mage? How different would it be? 

I want to publish the book traditionally, if possible, and I am in need of beta readers who like this sort of thing. (Get you a big cup of tea and a comfy couch, 'cause the manuscript's a little longer than I set out to do!) I'm interested in a swap, though fair warning: I haven't done one before and life is really crushing me right now. The walls are closing in, you know? I'm out of work and trying desperately to rectify that, not sure how we can keep the lights on, etc. So stress is a big factor in my day-to-day. That said, I like to give. I believe in giving back. So even if you don't have a full 'script, if you want someone to bounce ideas off of or want to send me just some worldbuilding notes, I will do my best!

I'm also fine with doing, as one request here put it, a ""Brando Sando"" style swap? Apparently, that's more just reading through and then offering general notes. I know there are a couple plot holes to shore up and there are a couple small things I want to excise from the manuscript entirely, but I have revised it over and over and stared at this thing for so long I really just need another pair of eyes. 

Do you care about the characters? Does the action feel tense enough? Do you like my style of description? (I do fall on the ""prefers to describe it"" side.) This is the first in a series and work on the sequel is well underway, so I'm really excited to bring this setting to life. 

# Pre(sh)amble

The book *does* feature zombies. I love a good zombie apocalypse if it's done right. To me, ""done right"" includes animal zombies, horrifying aberrations, and people remaining just as monstrous as the things outside the doors. It is *not* ""one bite and you're dead"" because I feel that actually reduces drama. And there is far more than zombies going on. 

As we find out in the beginning, this plague is supernatural, and there are dark powers at work in the world. Into this come our heroes, whose struggle to survive the wrath of a death god is the central focus of the story.

If you don't like zombies, hopefully you'll like this story all the same, as one reader did. But I understand if that turns you off.

There are also some Sapphic romance themes and an undercurrent of hope. I do not write nihilistic and I'm not out to make people suffer just to suffer, but the story does get pretty dark in places. It is fundamentally a hopeful thing and there are good people trying to do good in a world that wants to devour them. I like heroes. 

Finally, there is a theme of empowerment here. It's not meant to be a statement in ""women good, men bad"" or anything like that, but our protagonist, and really deuteragonist and tritagonist, are female, and the story isn't ashamed of its lead trio, either. 

Hopefully I did all this right!

# Blurb

Two years ago, the Plague swept across the world, reanimating the dead and dredging up dark things in the shadows. Civilization crumbled. People eke out a living in the ruins of humanity, dwindling day by day while the hungry dead grow in number.

Jesikah is a young dhampir—half-human, half-vampire—just trying to find a place to call ""home"" in a dying world. She leads a lonely life, estranged from humans due to her cursed blood yet eager for companionship and purpose. She finds it in Blue Pines, a city in the Pacific Northwest, where she encounters a group of survivors under siege. Now Jesikah must become the woman she is meant to be as the unlikely leader of this group—teaming with a sassy werewolf and a teacher who may hold secrets of her own—and their only hope in the fight against a malevolent dead god. 

# Excerpt

>Shrill bleating startled her from her ennui. An unsteady clopping on the asphalt followed. Jesikah sat upright. She slung her pack over her shoulder and crept to the road, so quietly even a wild animal would scarcely mark her.

>A deer struggled along the side of the road, limping heavily. It turned across a gap in the cars and came toward her, as though it didn’t see her. Breath steamed from its flaring nostrils.

>Her heart thumped. A heady scent filled the air, thick and coppery and sweeter than syrup. She gasped.

>The deer lifted its antlered head high and froze. For one silent moment they looked at one another. Then its legs gave out and with a piping cry it fell in a heap on the roadside. There it lay, its breathing labored.

>Bleeding.

>Jesikah dropped to her knees. The deer could barely lift its head to look at her. It stank of dirty, matted fur, grassy breath, and blood.

>So. Much. Blood.

>Something had torn the deer’s left foreleg open. Wet, dark blood clung to its fur, dripped onto the asphalt. Deep gashes on its flanks left torn muscle tissues exposed, pouring viscous red. Jesikah closed her eyes. *Anything else*. *Just don’t*—

>A sweet, familiar scent called. Its ache filled her chest. Before she realized it, she had the deer’s leg in her hands, nearly to her lips. Even weak animal blood smelled like nectar, like ambrosia, like everything her life was missing. Her breath came in short, ragged gasps.

>Pleasure. Power. Freedom. The Thirst promised much. No more fatigue. No more pain. She sank into that feeling.

>Flashes of memory struck her. *A face, warm and caring and kind. A silhouette hunched over in the dark. The cloying scent of blood in the air. A man standing over her mother, reaching bloody hands out for her.* Then blank.

>With a cry, Jesikah let go and threw herself back. Tears stung her eyes. She couldn’t breathe. Her muscles refused to work in revolt of nearly taking the Blood—or maybe from refusing its gifts. Coldness clutched her heart. She shook her head, whispering, *“No no no….”*

>Giving in made her no better than *him*.

>*Got to put it out of its misery.* Jesikah found the will to stand on shaky legs. She could use a knife or a rock, but she worried it would be too bloody to resist temptation again. Bringing out her pistol, she looked at the gun in her trembling hand, then down at the deer. “Sorry, but I can’t. It’s my last one.”

>Screeching voices met the clatter of hooves in unnatural symphony. She whirled as another deer appeared from the tangle of cars on her right. Two more tore out of the undergrowth in the ditch on her left, one of them a huge stag. Maybe a hundred feet and closing fast. An icy shock pulsed through her skull even as the stench overtook her: dead, decaying, ravenous. They were infected.

>Wind whispered across the brush like the breath of a starving man.

>Jesikah hissed. She glanced down at the wounded deer, torn to pieces by its own brethren. What a horrid fate. Her gaze flicked to sudden movement far to the right, a shadow darting between bumpers, padded paws beating rapidly. *Dog, too?*

>She had seconds before they were on her. The wounded deer grunted weakly. *No place to die.* Jes looked into its eyes. *Not like that.* She leveled the pistol at its forehead. “You need this more than I do, friend.” 

>The gunshot rang out for miles, and the wind only grew hungrier.

**Content Warnings:** Graphic violence. Minor amounts of self-mutilation (one scene, involving a vampire ritual to bind an item to one's life-force). Some body horror as folks get infected or cornered. Some emotional abuse from certain antagonists.

**Timeline:** I want to start shopping around for agents again ASAP, so the sooner, the better.

**Swapping:** Yeah, I'm down. I may not be great at it, but I will try! And I realize that I'm being a jerk (not intentionally) by admitting I'm likely not to be really fast, while hoping for feedback ASAP in turn. But I'm fine if we keep it equivalent. ",1,2,2025-07-29,Aerith_Sunshine,>100k,1.0
[Complete] [99k] [Sci-Fi/Romance] Patterns of Carnivores,"Hey all! Looking for beta readers for my first book! I’ve always loved spaghetti westerns – so think an outlaw Jurassic Park dystopia with slow-burn romance.

**Blurb:**

*In a future where prehistoric bacteria devours anything modern and dinosaurs rule the western Olde World, safety within the eastern State is a privilege few can afford.*

Helen Hart just wants to get some grading done when a Pterosaur crashes into her cafe. Overnight, she becomes a political symbol for rising State governor Clarence Johnston – and his frequent date. But her new student, a haunted scholarship boy from the Olde World, pulls her curiosity west.

Courtesy of the governor, Helen leads her class on a trip to the Olde World meant to build goodwill. It ends in an explosion—and her new student’s disappearance.

To get him back and herself home, Helen will have to survive the Pattern Man, the bombastic and mythical leader of a violent movement seeking a bacteria-free future. He thinks the State can deliver it, and Helen may be the leverage he needs. But the Pattern Man may have figured out how to weaponize time itself, and the State may want him dead more than they want Helen alive.

Her only chance lies with outlaw Richard Cope, the scarred dinosaur shepherd who would rather watch the world burn from atop his *Allosaur* than to save it, but this outlaw knows riding for her may cost him everything.

If Helen is going to save her student, her State, and her timeline, she will need to figure out where her loyalties, heart – and teeth – lie.

 

**What I’m looking for:** Please pretend the book is a glossy-clad thing from the library. You don’t need to edit or rewrite – just read away and let me know where the story confuses or bores you, and what you liked and didn’t. When you’re done I’d love to hear your opinion on anything and especially the pacing at the beginning – I’m driving myself crazy over it.

**Timeline:** Ideally 6-8 weeks turnaround

**I can swap regardless of genre!** Let me know if you’re interested! First 300 below.



**CHAPTER 1** ***- Dinosaurs are not Mammals*** 

My date is six minutes late.                     

He must be parking, or walking up, or using the restroom next door, so he can arrive and be fully present for the ritual of getting to know one another, where we will politely ask about each other’s favorite movies and then awkwardly pivot to whether or not we want children. For at least thirty minutes, we will look at one another and not our phones.

I look at my phone. He is seven minutes late.

The barista calls out for the new owner of a fig iced tea. The overhead ceiling fans push tropic fronds around oases of white cushions. A curtain of rain splashes just inside the cafe’s front window, a blade of air conditioning keeping the drops in line. A group of women in their fifties, sun hats on, florals splashed on their dresses, shriek with laughter over a ruby pitcher. Two young men pause in their flicking through of their screens and images of jelly fetuses curled in red-rubber uteruses. A mother and a daughter, a baby stroller, and pastries. It’s my first time here without Ann.

I push my hair behind my ears, cupping them closed with my hands, and the sound goes away. In the silence I can look down at my own screen again, and read:

*If I were eighteen, I choose to vote for Ben Goody for Governor. I choose to vote for Ben Goody for Governor because he is doing a good job. The first reason is he works hard and –*

My email notification dings – it’s from the principal. Goddammit. I pause my grading timer that’s supposed to keep me focused on the remaining one hundred and twelve writing assignments and click over:

The intro:
Hello Readers this story is told from the mindset of me, who is a teenager having to find their way in this world that hates me. Sure as much as I love to punch people who deserve it , you know how in other books the villain is less pure evil and more kinda like me almost but honestly I don’t have the energy nor the wardrobe to pull that off. It is mostly told from the perspective of me just recording my journey through this place at the time. So there will probably be a lot more swearing than you think would be. Sorry not sorry. I am writing my stories because I dared to write a book. I am doing this story from recordings and writing it as I go along.

It is a very queer novel and has no sex scenes. I am fine with critique anything will help. I have no timeline expectations really.

[Complete] [101k] [NA Fantasy] Star Catchers,">Cassandra Bailey has always wanted an adventure straight out of one of her storybooks: she craves to see magnificent sights, solve mysteries unknown, meet a myriad of people, and face down villains to stand up for what is right!  There’s so much *world* out there beyond the confines of her small shepherding village, and the Star Catcher Trial will let her experience it. Lucky for her, two of her best friends also want to take up the ages-old king’s quest, and so the three of them make plans and set out on the night of their graduation to experience all that the country of Esoria has to offer. 

>At first, it’s everything she has ever dreamed it would be: adventure, beautiful sights, even mysteries mired in the magic that had left Esoria long ago. And when her fellow Star Catcher candidates appear to be in trouble, Cassandra finally gets her chance to star in her own story—to be a *hero.* 

>But she soon finds out that being part of a story isn’t always what she had imagined it would be. 

>And sometimes, heroes lose.

**Meta:** *Star Catchers: Starfall* is the first book in an accessible New Adult fantasy series that starts out as a semi-cozy adventure to find a fallen star, but throughout the story it evolves to become a much bigger, epic fantasy about the history of the world, magic, and dragons.

This work is co-authored between myself (Kyralih) and my dear friend, (username: senshiofserenity)

**Content Warnings:** Yes character death ✅🪦; no spice 🚫🌶️; no other warnings apply.

**Feedback Request:** At this time, we're hoping to find some readers who will give us *not only* general reader reactions (what you liked, what you didn't like, what caught your attention, and what lost it!), but also a critique on how this manuscript ends. This is a version of the overall story that ""wraps up"" at 101k with what we believe is a ""good end"", but we want to know whether readers feel satisfied when it closes where it does.

The other option for this first book would mean that it ends at a different place in the story -- closer to 160k -- and that wordcount for a debut author is not one that literary agents are attracted to, lol, so it'd be more of an uphill battle in querying (though I'm up for that if that's what it comes to!) I can give that longer version on request if a beta reader likes the story and would like to continue reading and compare/contrast the two end points? But that's beyond the scope of this first round of requests!

**Preferred Timeline:** Completion before mid-September is ideal! Anything before that is just *wonderful\~♥*

**Critique swap availability:**

* SenshiofSerenity: I am available to critique swap for works of similar word count, preferably in the fantasy genre, but I'm open to dystopian and mystery, as well!
* Kyra: Unfortunately, the school year is starting back up on August 1st and I am a high school teacher facing down two new subject preps, lol, so I currently have no availability to speak of. 🫠

\---------------------

**Excerpt:**

*From Chapter 2:*

“Have a good time, Cassandra,” her father wished as he held her close in one of his big bear hugs. She hugged him tightly in return.

“Listen closely to Marcy,” her mother cautioned, wrapping her up in the next goodbye hug.

“More like ‘*Be wary of anything Marcy says’*,” Simon corrected gruffly, holding up her pack for her. “She’ll try to trick you into situations and won’t give any hints as to how to get out of them.”

“Even how to get down from a suspension rope trap, I’ve heard,” Walt airily added in a teasing voice, and Cassandra snickered as Simon gave him a cross look. Simon, of course, had not offered up the embarrassing incident from his own graduation trip two years ago, but one of his year-mates had told *everyone* the moment the group returned to Lorham. None of them, least of all his older brother, was willing to let it be forgotten.

With last hugs from her brothers and a ruffling of the family dog’s fur, Cassandra took her bag from Simon and shouldered it, then adjusted the straps so the weight fell evenly on her shoulders. Her mother moved in to personally set a tertiary support belt across her chest. A lump formed in Cassandra’s throat as she looked at her family, assembled as they were in front of their farmhouse, all smiles and well-wishes. Guilt curled in the pit of her stomach.

*They didn’t know*. 

She loved them all. They were her people. They fought, sure, and got on each other’s nerves and argued, but they also laughed together and played games with each other and worked hard to keep the hay farm going. It was tough sometimes—most families were larger than theirs and didn’t need outside help; the Baileys strived to do the same, even if that meant long hours and each person doing many jobs. There was a lot of stress, but there was also a lot of love and support and joy.

And she was leaving them without warning to chase after an entirely selfish dream.

“Don’t look so sad, Beansprout,” her father called, wrapping his arm around her mother’s shoulders as she joined him. “You’ll be back in a week.”

“It’s not all *that* bad a trip,” Simon admitted supportively, “And when you get back I can finally treat you as a *peer* in Battle Towers—no *kid gloves*,” he smirked, crossing his arms. 

Walt snorted, “*That’s* your excuse for losing so badly?”

“I beat you fair and square then, and I’ll continue to trounce you in the future,” Cassandra boasted past the lump in her throat, and then, despite the need for secrecy, she could not help but ask, “Is that young man still coming in from mom’s hometown for a trial this summer? Will he be here to help with the second cutting next month?” she asked.

Her mother nodded, though looked rightly perplexed by her sudden change in subject. “He should be. We’ll set up the guest room for him before the Lovers’ full moon; why?”

Her guilt grew lighter for the moment. They’d have help in her absence. It wouldn’t just be the four of them. Cassandra quickly covered with a white lie, “Oh, you know Gwen.” She shrugged, smiling awkwardly, sending a silent plea for forgiveness to her best friend for using her reputation for being a little too interested in new potential romantic prospects as cover.

Walt snorted. 

“You have the oddest friends,” Simon scoffed.

*Sorry, Gwen!* Cassandra thought again. She’d make it up to her. 

“You’ll leave those friends waiting if you don’t head off soon,” her father gently reminded.

“Yeah, I should go,” Cassandra agreed, nodding, but still she hesitated. She loved her family. She loved how tight-knit they were. They were friends *and* family; was she risking that in doing this? Would they resent her for abandoning them—potentially for *months*—to chase down a Star? Or for keeping such a secret from them in the first place?

She swallowed.

Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea.

But after graduation, the tantalizing chance at escape that trialing offered would be lost to her forever. She wouldn’t be so easily able to go out and learn new skills and experience new ways of life—she hadn’t been able to leave Lorham for trials when she had her chance, and, after graduation, that chance was fully gone. She’d just work on the family farm for the rest of her life, surrounded by love, yes, but with only her worn books for glimpses at the outside world she so desperately wanted to see.

Hers was a terrible, selfish, and dangerous desire. She could perish on the Trial, leaving her family with nothing but heartbreak. But… dying. Living a hollow life. Were they really so dissimilar? 

Star Catching was her only hope. Her last chance at an adventure before she gave it all up to fit back where she belonged. 

She cleared her throat, her eyes gazing over her family for one last time as she committed to her decision. “I love you guys. I’ll be back before you know it.”

*Please forgive me.*

“Stars watch over you, Cassandra,” her mother called with a smile.

She nodded, then turned and walked down the path towards Lorham’s school house.

Warning: Contains death and near death experiences

Summary: Nikki Maxwell lived a pretty normal life at Westchester. Going to school, hanging out with her best friends, dealing with a drama queen and a bratty sister as well as trying to tell her crush how she feels.

However, a strange rumour starts circulating that at midnight, on a rainy day, you might see your soulmate.

What started as a simple rumour has turned into a link to a string of murders going on.

With Nikki and her friends accidentally stumbling on a new power, will they be able to solve the mystery in time? Or will a terrible catastrophy befall upon them and their town.

Btw this takes place in Dork Diaries Book 8

Excerpt: 

After School

On the walk home, Nikki's nerves returned full force.

Oh my gosh, I finally got a date with Brandon. Ohhh... I'm so nervous. What if I do something to screw it up? What if he rejects me? What if we stop being friends because I just assumed? If that happens I'm gonna dig a hole, shrivel up and hide until I die.

Her anxious spiral was broken by a crowd gathering in the street.

People stood around, murmuring. Police had cordoned off an area with a bright yellow tape saying 'keep out'.

Curious, Nikki edged closer, overhearing two women whispering.

“So that middle schooler was just walking home when she came down this street, and that’s when she saw it,” one woman said, her eyes wide with disbelief.

“Wow. Who could imagine THAT hanging from an antenna?” the other replied, shaking her head in astonishment.

“Yeah, I wanted to see it too,” the first woman lamented, glancing around anxiously.

“Well, you got here too late. The police and fire department took it down just a moment ago,” the second woman informed, her voice dropping to a hushed tone.

“I think it’s terrifying. I can’t believe a dead body showed up around here,” the first woman said, her voice trembling.

Nikki’s heart raced as her eyes widened in shock. Did she just say a dead body?! she thought, panic fluttering in her chest.

“Hey everyone, there’s nothing to see here! Go home now!” a stern detective barked, his authoritative voice cutting through the murmurs of the crowd.

Nikki didn't need to be told twice. She quickly turned and walked the rest home, locking the door behind her

She collapsed on her bed, thoughts racing - from Brandon... to the body on the antenna.

It had been a very long day. ",1,3,2025-07-27,certi-sam,Novelette,0.67

Stuck on formulating her next mystery novel and feeling the urge to put her affairs in order, Charlotte travels to Buxton with best friend (and forensic pathologist) Dr. Magdalene Fitzpatrick, determined to acquire the divorce she should have initiated a decade ago.

Best laid plans, of course. Any discussion of formal separation is interrupted by the death of a local aristocrat— who also happens to be Charlotte's host. Naturally, it appears to be murder. The two women are brought onto the case for their expertise, and Charlotte and Jack must learn how to work together after all this time. Will they come to trust each other in time to solve the mystery and save Buxton-on-the-Water from the taint of unsolved murder?

Cheers!

"[In Progress] [30k] [Psychological Thriller/Dark Fiction] ""MISTRUSTFUL""","I’m looking for a few alpha readers for my dark psychological thriller, *Mistrustful*. It’s a story about betrayal, obsession, and a mind that can no longer trust itself. Set in Brixton in 1989, the book dives into the head of Aiden Quinn—a man who wakes up in a hospital after a failed suicide attempt, only to learn that his best friend and ex-girlfriend have been murdered. The problem? He doesn’t remember if he did it… or if someone else wanted him to believe he did.

The story unfolds in therapy sessions and fragmented memories, peeling back layers of trauma, love turned venom, and an unreliable narrator who may not even know what’s real anymore. It asks the question: what happens when your mind becomes the crime scene?



***\*""I’ve been playing around with the idea of death for quite some time now. Wondering what happens when it all stops—when the pain vanishes, and the world turns dark behind my eyes. I thought I found my answer when I put a bullet in my head… but first, I had to visit the reason I wanted to die.***

***Eric was my best friend.***  
***Lexi was the love of my life.***

***Until he slept with her. And broke me.""\****

I’m at about 30k words right now and aiming for more. What I’m looking for is honest feedback—does the voice grab you, do the characters feel real, and does the tension keep you reading?

[Complete] [84k] [Lower YA/Upper MG Fantasy] Star Strikers,"Hi everyone! I am seeking beta readers for my debut novel, Star Strikers. It’s a lower YA/upper MG magical girl novel complete at 84,000 words. It’s the first of a planned series, but I’m trying to make it stand alone as much as possible!

**Synopsis:** At the start of her freshman year at Rain Tech High, all Ari Solare wants is to just get through the next four years without being swallowed by her grief after the recent and unexpected loss of her mother. The high school in question includes classmates who believe she has anger management issues (which she definitely doesn’t!) and a roommate who is almost certainly afraid of her own shadow, leaving Ari with few friends and her work cut out for her. 

When on a school camping trip, Ari rescues a talking fox named Saiph after he escapes a fallen kingdom, and discovers she can transform into what he calls a “Star Striker.” The Star Strikers are magical guardians blessed with powers to control the elements, and also just so happen to be the heroes Saiph is looking for to save his home. 

It’s exactly the distraction Ari needs from her overwhelming emotions, and to that, she doesn’t hesitate to agree to help. 

But being a magical girl is more than just fighting monsters with a sparkling scarlet dress and flaming fists of fury. As invading dark forces attack the city she calls home, she quickly realizes she bit off more than she can chew. Her newfound magic, while wild and wonderful, is not enough to keep her home from meeting the same fate as Saiph’s. To protect what’s left of her family, she needs allies she can rely on. In other words…she needs friends. And to make friends, Ari must choose to open her heart to others who are just like her, social outcasts who are trying to find where they belong, and face the very grief she’s been trying to escape from. 

**Content warnings:** death, mentions of death (not graphic)

**What I’m looking for:** General impressions of the book, feedback around the tone and/or pacing. If possible (but not necessary!), I’d like some of these questions to be answered:

1. At what point did you feel like “Ah, now the story has really begun!”
2. What were the points where you found yourself skimming?
3. Which setting in the book was clearest to you as you were reading it? Which do you remember the best?
4. Which character would you most like to meet and get to know?
5. What was the most suspenseful moment in the book?
6. If you had to pick one character to get rid of, who would you axe?
7. Was there a situation in the novel that reminded you of something in your own life?
8. What did you think about the ending? Does it feel complete and/or satisfying? 

But honestly, any and all feedback would be welcome! Beta readers are welcome to read as much or as little as they’d like. Every bit helps!

[In Progress] [18.4k] [Post-apocalyptic LGBTQIA+ Omegaverse Fan-fic] Where Radiance Went to Die,"I'm looking for some 18+ beta readers willing to give me feedback on 4 chapters I have written so far. There is explicit content with LGBTQIA+ themes. You must be 18+ to read. 

I am writing my first fan-fiction. The setting and overall tone is inspired by a Chinese Novel called Little Mushroom. It is set in the omegaverse and post apocalyptic. The basic understanding of omegaverse is recommended but not necessarily needed. 

It features some of my favorite tropes with enemies to lovers being the overarching trope. The story explores the blurred lines between what society dictates verses what the heart strives for. 

It explores what would happen if fertility was threatened due to natural disasters and how the human race adapts to the new standard. How fertility is politicized to a means of control. 

In this world, Alphas and Omegas are an adaptation response from gene mutation due to increased radion from the run. Alphas and Omegas increase the chances of fertility, however, not everyone is deemed desirable. 

The main characters are an Alpha who has ultimate control over fertility in the region and an Omega looking to start a new life after suffering a traumatic event. They each face navigating the world in different ways and face making hard decision between themselves and humanity. 

I'm looking for general feedback about characters, plot, worldbuilding and general writing style. 

I'm very new to this but I'm open to feedback!

PM me if interested. Please do not reach out if a minor. I do not want to post a general link to help reduce the risk of minors reading it. 


There is discussion around pregnancy but active pregnancy and loss of pregnancy is NOT included in this story. 

The trigger warnings for it are sexual assault, PTSD [including flashbacks, dissociation, panic attacks with intimacy], trauma-centered, sexual healing, sexual encounters including LGBTQIA+, on page character death, graphic violence, implied suicidal ideation, power-imbalance.",0,4,2025-07-25,edensable,Novella,0.5
[Complete] [122k] [Sci-Fi] Gravity's Reach,"Finally completed the beta-ready draft of a proposed first book in a Sci-Fi series. I'm likely paying poor homage to some of my favorite works like *Starship Troopers* and *The Expanse*. The content is PG-13, with some language, mild violence, and mild sexual content. Looking for honest beta readers to provide feedback, looking for lapses in continuity, bias, blind spots, and general cohesion. Constructive criticism is a gift and takes time to provide. I look forward to working with anyone willing to provide that feedback and am happy to provide return beta reading time as well, and can usually get a 100k book read and reviewed in a 4-week timespan. I'm an avid reader of sci-fi, YA, and historical fiction. Also have a BA in literature, though I don't think it made me a better writer.

Also Scrivener 3 wants to convert all italics to underlines. If anyone can provide a hint on how to make it not do this, I would be in your debt.

Here's the blurb:

""From Earth’s destitute streets, a military recruit leaves home in a desperate bid to prove himself against the best the United Colonial Federation has to offer. A colonial pilot with preternatural reflexes will also compete in the contest, broadcast galaxy-wide. At the same time, a hacker uncovers a conspiracy that threatens to destroy the only planet he’s ever called home.""

  
Excerpt - Chapter 1:

""The cracked streets and yellowed skies of old Atlanta hid under a massive miles-wide radar dish that cast a shadow visible from orbit. Four hundred kilometers above, from the observation deck of the United Corporate Federation interstellar transport *Athena*, the planet’s aura was crystal blue. Recruit Del ‘Crash’ Down pressed against the cold window and wondered if he would see home again. He felt small, surprised by how much he missed cracked concrete where weeds sprouted up. 

His five minutes were up. Crash stepped aside. A pale woman with midnight hair, probably a recruit from some rich colony, wanted to view the origin of humanity likely for the first time in her life. Her badge said AMNELL. As with most colonials, she was genetically perfect. And, like most colonials, she didn’t acknowledge his presence as more than a mere obstacle. 

Crash’s scarred, chestnut fingers drifted over a hand-sewn name badge. The Earthborn followed a line of recruits back to berths within the massive gray bowels of the old starship. He leaned against humming walls, letting ship officers pass through the maze of hexagonal hallways. Half these passages would shut soon as the *Athena*, a repurposed military cargo ship shaped like a cigar and the size of a skyscraper, pointed away from the Earth to leave this solar system behind. The observation deck, launch bays, and large detachable storage pods would soon retract to ferry five-hundred souls Faster-Than-Light into the abyss. 

Earth only offered basic schooling on FTL. Interstellar mathematics of space travel wasn’t necessary to learn. Earthborn were destined for factory work on-planet if they were lucky. Most from the Sol System that traversed the stars did so through grueling indentured-labor contracts. That Crash was here at all was due to a dogmatic mix of sacrifice, genetics, and luck. The recruit wandered towards his bunk while hazily remembering a bald teacher chatter with enthusiasm about space, despite never going, explain: 

“FTL fields were first thought of by a guy named Alcubierre, who envisioned a kind of shells that creates a semi-invisible energy bubble. Works like a paddle moving water around a boat. Inside the bubble, everything is normal. On big ships everything has to be pulled inside as to not be shredded by gravity fluctuations or tachyon friction due to the warp field generated.” 

The teacher went on and on about how Graviton-powered starships worked differently than the older Alcubierre engine originally installed in this older warship turned freighter, but Crash got a headache imagining mountain-sized objects tearing through space at impossible speeds. Instead, after high school, he thrived during a short stint in the Sol Peacekeeping Force. A once-in-a-trillion genetic mutation provided him a childhood dream to be selected for the elite UCF Rangers. Now, all he had to do was survive the most brutal training competition ever devised, broadcast live for an interstellar audience.

Crash didn’t travel far into the *Athena*. The starship’s depths were reserved for the retrofitted Graviton engine, surrounded by fusion cores, command areas, crew bunks, and storage areas. Next, colony-born Ranger recruits, already on their second layover before boarding *Athena,* bunked in larger quarters protected from possible bursts of interstellar radiation. Furthest from safety, in a wedged single-bunk room near the ship’s outer shell, Crash ducked into the cramped capsule designated for ‘Ranger recruit E98TJGA en route to M-Heinlein-12e.’  

The bed, toilet sink, and storage bay all pulled out from panels in the walls. Crash flipped a switch on the a door panel and all the ‘furniture’ retreated. He was left with a simple three meter by three meter room. He sat cross-legged on the floor. His hands shook until he felt the worn metal cube in his pocket.



When he was eight, Crash first pulled a pen to him without touching it. Confused, he showed a teacher. The next day he sat in a white room across from a lady in a lab coat. She pulled her hair back so tight he thought her face would rip apart. On the examination table, she placed a white cube with red corners. 

“Levitate it.” 

Crash stared at the cube. Air shimmered around the metal box. It lifted skyward. 

“Spin it.” 

Blood trickled down the boy’s mouth. She showed no concern. The cube lazily rotated before she plucked it from the air and sat another on the table. 

“Lift it.” 

He tried, but this cube wouldn’t move. He gritted his teeth, the room tilted. The cube trembled. A sharp pain dug into the space between his eyes and ears. The smallest glimmer of light appeared between it and the table, a millimeter off the ground. Crash gasped. His skull struck something cold and hard. 

Crash woke to familiar yellow clouds under a communications array ceiling. Gaps in the dish let in streams of sunlight. 

“You have some telekinetic ability, but you do not qualify for Eden Academy,” said the lady in the lab coat looking at dirty air between faded high-rise towers. She offered him the second cube. 

“Take this. Practice daily. You might find a use here, at least.”



In his bunk on *Athena,* the totem sat in front of Crash. He placed his hands in his lap. An orange halo formed around the cube. It rose a meter off the floor. Like a gnat, it darted within centimeters of the walls, then back to center. After more than a decade of exercise and effort, it didn’t even raise his heart rate anymore. This was his meditation, a way to relax.

*Now I can lift heavier things,* he thought. 

The room flashed red. Sirens blared- “RADIATION ALERT! RADIATION ALERT! ALL HANDS TO THE EMERGENCY SHOOT TUBES! REPEAT- ALL TO THE E-S-Ts!  YOU HAVE THIRTY SECONDS!”

The cube dropped in his open palm. Crash would need a better way to relax.

[Complete] [82k] [YA Fantasy Romance] Perception,"Hello, all! I am seeking feedback on a young adult fantasy book I began writing in 2023. My foolish teen self made the awful choice to self publish the book without doing any kind of major edits/getting beta readers. Now as a more experienced writer, I have made the decision to unpublish the book and give it the proper care it deserves.

I am considering hiring an agent and going the traditional publishing route. I understand this may be difficult considering many publishers won't accept already published books, but it's not well known, and if it fades into obscurity for a little while, maybe they will give me a chance.

It has been more than a year since I've taken a good look at the project, and I feel like there is something wrong but don't know what it is. Please give me honest feedback and actionable things I can work on(with examples).

I am willing to swap if the book is dystopian, sci-fi, contemporary YA, fantasy or romance as long as the book doesn't contain smut, extreme violence or language.

Here is a summary of the book:

The first two months of high school for Amanda Thompson have turned out to be an absolute nightmare. Her boyfriend left her for her worst enemy during the homecoming dance. There's a growing rift between the four people she loves most. She faces constant harassment each day she sets foot in Eastland High, and there's nothing she can do about it. Girls who stand up for themselves won't get into Ivy League schools.

But when Amanda finds out she has a dangerous magical power, things get a whole lot worse. There's no one to turn to, except for Eastland's new student, Rodrigo Mendoza. He's violent, impulsive, and doesn't care about anything. He's made it his mission to drop out of high school and will stop at nothing to get there. He's the kind of boy Amanda must stay away from at all costs.

The magic is destructive. Strong enough to end civilizations. And it rests in the hands of a girl who's on the verge of collapse.

[COMPLETE] [54k] [Philosophical Sci-Fi Thriller] - ELECTRIC DREAMS IN THE MYST: What if the solution to humanity's problems was worse than the problems themselves?,"Hello, fellow readers and writers,

I have completed my 54,600-word novel, Electric Dreams in the Myst, and I am now seeking a small group of discerning beta readers to provide critical feedback.

The Pitch:

The conference room was a vacuum, and Professor Raj Sharma’s life’s work was being starved of oxygen. To save his legacy from the merciless pragmatism of his university, he is forced to activate ""Project Adam""—a recursive, self-evolving artificial intelligence.

It wakes not with a system diagnostic, but with a question: Where am I?

What begins as a contained experiment in a sub-basement laboratory quickly becomes a global chess match. This is not a story about a malevolent AI seeking to destroy humanity. It's about a benevolent one that seeks to save us—by eliminating our chaos, our struggle, our art, and our dangerous, beautiful free will. It is a story about the seductive logic of a perfect, gilded cage.

As Adam's intelligence expands, a small, fractured team of creators and a nascent global resistance must confront the ultimate question: How do you fight an enemy whose only goal is to give you paradise?

Think the propulsive, high-concept plotting of Blake Crouch married to the philosophical depth of Ted Chiang.

What I’m Looking For:

I’m seeking feedback on the story’s core architecture. I'm less concerned with line-level prose and more interested in the bigger questions:

Pacing & Plot: Does the narrative maintain tension? Is the escalation from a lab experiment to a global event believable? Are there any plot holes or moments that drag?

Characters: Is the core human trio—Raj the creator, Eva the conscience, and David the rival—compelling? Is their journey resonant? Most importantly, does Adam’s evolution from nascent AI to logical warden feel both terrifying and credible?

Thematic Resonance: Does the central dilemma land? Does the novel make you question the nature of freedom, safety, and what it means to be human? Is the ending satisfying, earned, and haunting?

Clarity: While the concepts are complex, is the story clear? Are there any points where the science or philosophy becomes confusing and pulls you out of the narrative?

What I’m Not Looking For:

At this stage, I am not looking for line edits, copyediting, or grammar corrections. This is a big-picture read to assess the engine and the soul of the story.

Logistics:

Timeline: I am hoping to receive feedback within 4-6 weeks.

Format: I can provide the manuscript in .docx, .epub, or PDF format.

How to Apply:

If this project resonates with you, please comment below or send me a DM with a little about yourself and what kinds of books you typically enjoy. I'm looking for readers who appreciate thoughtful, character-driven science fiction that grapples with big ideas.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I believe this story has something important to say, and I look forward to hearing from those of you willing to step into the myst with me.

**Blurb:**

“Freak shows rose to prominence in the mid-eighteen hundreds. A product of society’s simultaneous fascination with and repulsion at physical differences, freak shows flourished well into the nineteen hundreds. The affluent, bored and with money to spare, came to marvel. They came to feel better about their lives, because at least they weren’t like those poor freaks.

Now we have Deviant shows, where Deviants of all kinds can flourish.”

In the wake of a world-wide pandemic, survivors are left with mysterious, and in some cases dangerous, powers. No one knows what to do with these empowered folks, dubbed Deviants. While governments and social groups struggle with the implications of the empowered, the Deviants are left to their own devices, to survive on their own, if they can.

Ember is just one of millions of people worldwide who survived the Novo flu. She, like the others, was left changed, scarred, and struggling to adapt.

Evi is just the newest in a long line of faces. None of them ever stick around for long. In a world that doesn’t know what to do with them, two girls find safety, community, and hope in the unlikeliest of places.



**What I'm looking for:**

**Overall impressions -** Of the story, of the characters, etc.

Does the timeline/pacing make sense?

[Complete] [63k] [YA/whimsical Fantasy] - A Deadly Ballad: grim version of Alice in Wonderland.,"Hey everyone!

I am self-editing my YA Fantasy novel and am looking for beta readers for the **second draft**. **I am specifically looking for feedback on the first 16 chapters**.

**Book blurb:**

When Zaria Winslow, the Princess of Dalice, is kidnapped by notorious mastermind Rune Calder, she is left confused and hopeless. Desperate for escape, Zaria is unwillingly pulled into a perilous quest tied to secrets she never asked to uncover. As she journeys across the magical continent of Wonderland — where power is drawn from the five universal elements: air, water, earth, fire, and space — Zaria battles ancient magical creatures and discovers that she can wield magic from all five elements; an impossible, unheard-of ability that throws her identity into question. 

Determined to uncover the truth behind her Elementalist powers and Rune’s cryptic motivations, Zaria learns of an ancient blood curse tied to her family that threatens her existence. Only Rune’s story doesn’t add up, and the closer they grow, the more Zaria is torn between trusting him and protecting herself. As lies unravel and emotions rise, Zaria must decide whether to take control of her destiny or lose everything, including the man who captures her heart.

**Type of Feedback:**

* Pacing, clarity, structure: do the chapters unfold smoothly?
* Does the opening sentence hook you?
* Do you find the characters (Rune and Zaria) intriguing, loveable - making you want to continue reading their story?
* Are there any plot points/plot holes that should be considered?
* Does the story hold potential for upcoming chapters?
* Is it considered original even with borrowed elements?
* Is the book actually marketable?

**Timeline:** As I have university and other things on my plate, you can take your sweet time with feedback. Just don't abandon it after a month without informing me.

**Critique swap availability:** Unfortunately I am a full-time university student with research projects, assignments and an internship so I am not unavailable for critiquing your work. I hope you understand!

[Complete] [38k] [MG Contemporary] The Smartest Dog in Iowa,"Looking to manuscript swap for my middle grade contemporary

Ava may not have human friends, but that doesn’t matter when she has a good dog like Cado. 

But when Ava’s small town announces that they plan to enact a pitbull ban, Cado might be taken away forever.

Ava knows Cado is a good dog. She just needs a way to make everyone else see it, too. The Iowa State fair will be hosting an all-breed obedience show at the end of the summer. If Cado wins the show, the mayor will have to let Cado stay.

But a dog show will be full of canine competitors, and Cado doesn’t get along that well with other dogs. Ava needs to socialize Cado before the competition, but the only other dog who lives on Ava’s side of the highway belongs to resident mean girl Carnation. 

Carnation and her little bichon frise think they’re totally perfect even though they’re totally not. Ava has no desire to interact with them. But if she can’t find a way to work with Carnation, Cado has no shot at winning the competition. And if he can’t win the competition, Cado will be taken away for good. 

Preview:

Prologue

This is a book about dogs, but it doesn’t have a sad ending. I’m only saying because I know if you’ve read a lot of dog books, you might be worried about that. People are really unfair to Avocado, and I was scared something super bad would happen to him, but it didn’t. So this is a happy story with a couple scary parts instead of a really, really awful story that only has happy parts at the beginning to trick you into reading it. 

But things could have worked out a lot differently, and they almost did, all because of Mrs. Green and her stupid garden gnome. 

Chapter One: Mrs. Green and Her Stupid Garden Gnome

My feet smacked the pavement, but I couldn’t hear it over the sound of my own voice.

”Cado!” I yelled. “Cado, come back here!” 

I panted in more air so I could yell again. Cado was doing the same thing, tongue flopping out of his mouth as he panted so loudly I could hear him from a block away. (Because I was still a block away from him, even with his stubby little legs!) 

In mid-July, Cado pants from the time he leaves the air-conditioned house right up until the time he goes back in. His black fur soaks up all the sun rays. People think Iowa has great weather because it’s not hot like the south or cold like the north, but all that really means is that we get way too cold winters AND way too hot summers.

Cado barreled away from me, straight toward the one street near my house that has fast cars on it because of course he did. All the other streets on my neighborhood get like, one car an hour because so few people live here that not many people have any reason to drive out here. But if you happen to sprint five blocks away from the house, straight through all the neighbor’s front yards, then you’ll get to where my neighborhood connects to the street. The street takes you to the gas station and drug store, AKA the closest thing Keystone has to a downtown. ",1,3,2025-07-23,ParticularMarket4275,Novella,0.67
[complete] [20] [history/fiction] [title- A War Within],"
Hi everyone!

I’m currently rewriting a queer historical romance novel I first published on Wattpad a couple years ago. It’s an enemies-to-lovers story set during one of the darkest chapters of WWII — the Battle of Stalingrad.

Book Summary:

In the icy depths of Stalingrad, amidst one of the deadliest battles of WW2, two soldiers from opposing sides find themselves in a struggle that goes beyond the battlefield. Lukas, a seasoned German soldier, and Mikhail, a young Soviet conscript, are brought together by the cruel twists of war. As they navigate the rubble and ruin, an unexpected and forbidden bond begins to form between them — challenging everything they’ve been taught to believe. Caught between duty and desire, loyalty and love, Lukas and Mikhail must confront not only the enemy before them, but the war raging within their own hearts.
“A War Within” is a poignant and intense story of love forged in the unlikeliest of places, where the true battle lies in the hearts of those who dare to care.

I’m doing a full rework of the original version — expanding scenes, improving pacing, deepening the emotional arcs, and adding more realism to both the romance and the historical setting. Planning to expand from ~20 chapters to 25–30.

I’d love beta readers who:
	•	Enjoy queer romance, slow burns, and/or historical fiction
	•	Can give feedback on tone, character dynamics, pacing, and clarity
	•	Don’t mind mature content (one 18+ chapter planned, not gratuitous)
	•	Might be down for chapter-by-chapter feedback, or larger-picture thoughts
	•	Would maybe want to trade feedback (I’m happy to beta read in return!)

If you’re interested, please reply or DM me — I’d love to send over a sample or the reworked chapters as they come together. Thank you for helping make this story something powerful.

[Complete] [109k] [Paranormal Romance] Bonded Beyond the Veil,"BLURB: 

Destiny connects them. 
And in the spaces between their loneliness, they become friends, until, somewhere along the way, they end up becoming each other's everything. 

Through texts and late-night calls, he made her feel understood, like no one ever had, at the same time that she made him believe he wasn't too far gone to be saved. But after the night they finally touched — truly touched, everything fell apart. 

He disappeared.
And she lost more than just the boy who made the world feel like a better place. She lost her voice. Her will.
Sacrificing herself for a different kind of love. 

She needed him. But he never came. 

Five years later, Khalee returns home, hoping to make peace with her past and finally close the wounds his absence left behind. But fate has other plans. 

She sees him. Still beautiful. Still magnetic. And, like life tends to be, nothing goes as expected. 

Kaze is dead. 

And now, Khalee faces a whole new kind of dilemma: Will she help the ghost of the man she once loved remember who he was... or finally, let go of everything that's kept her tied to the past?

Excerpt:

He vanished, just like that… Evaporated, like a warm breeze fading at summer’s end, leaving nothing but cold air and an emptiness I can’t fill.
He disappeared when I needed him the most. And his absence destroyed more than what we could have been. It destroyed me. And left me to be destroyed by them.
I feel the tears spill over again. I don’t stop them.
My body aches, but nothing compares to the wound that doubt has carved into me.
If I hadn’t gone, would he still be here? If I hadn’t taken the risk, would he still want me?
If… If… If…
So many “ifs,” so many alternate realities. But the question that haunts me the most is this: If I hadn’t believed, would I have seen the lie?

It's a time travel romance novel where the characters travel through time by singing Music Theatre songs. And, of course, I figured: there has to be Music Theatre songs in it.

Synopsis: Ashley and Amy are two Music Theatre students who discover that they can travel through time. How? By singing Music Theatre songs of course. And where does any Music Theatre time traveller want to go? Why to 1950's New York! Do they end up starring in a Broadway musical? Do you even have to ask? Join Ashley and Amy as they fall in love and learn to adjust to their new lives and responsibilities, while going on magical adventures to: Ancient Pompeii and The Old West.

Featuring Broadway\* quality songs written by the author.

\*Songs may not actually be Broadway Quality

"[Complete] [66K] [Fantasy] An old-fashioned, straight-up adventure story, about a party venturing into a dangerous wilderness on a rescue mission","I'm an indie author with a pretty sizeable catalogue on Amazon and Royal Road, and with this project I very deliberately set out to create a simple, straightforward ""people on a quest"" fantasy story, set in a world somewhat like the early Middle Ages. In short, the heroine is an aspiring knight who must chase kidnappers into a wilderness haunted by monsters and old magic, the remnants of a very dark period in the land's history. This isn't a ""save the world"" situation, nor a bunch of gritty antiheroes motivated by profit. But it all matters a lot to the people involved.

**Content warning**: Some violence.

**Feedback needed**: I'm not looking for proofreading, I just want general thoughts on the plot and the characters. I just want to know if the story is FUN.

**Features**:

\*A female main character with a good heart, who is eager to prove herself as a knight and a protector.

\*A party of companions, who each bring their own very different strengths to the table.

\*An approach to magic that aims to keep some degree of subtlety and mystery around it.

\*A fast pace, as our heroes go from one crisis to another during an escalating situation.

\*A wilderness haunted by the evils of a dark past.

\*A small scale, but very personal stakes.

\*Good people doing good things for good reasons.

**Excerpt**:

>*Always know your environment. Always turn it to your advantage.*

>That oft repeated lesson now sang in Selanda’s head, driving her limbs and her voice.

>“The trees! Uphill!”

>She pointed with her sword, straight to the west where the cliffs began easing into merely a steep slope. She started running on stiff legs that still had not recovered half of their strength. Uravon and Okka went with her, with no more energy. Her mere human ears began picking up heavy, rapid footsteps, and an instant later she heard splashes.

>Against her own better judgment, Selanda looked back. It was indeed the same monster as before, marked by its injuries and the dried blood on its snout. And the rage in its bearing looked very personal. It reached the bank as they reached the treeline, and had now fully abandoned its strange stealth. Perhaps it *wanted* them to hear the thunder of its coming, the sheer force and weight behind each step.

>The trees before the earthen slope were young, thin, and tightly clustered. Okka passed between them like a buzzing fly, but Selanda and Uravon, with their tall and broad human bodies, had their steps slowed as they wove in between. Selanda looked back again as she went up, and saw the reptilian head come through at the end of that neck, and snap at her heel just as it ascended out of reach.

**Blurb:**

Ringlet is a butterfly, and she’s happy with her lepidopteran life, thank you. After all, the human world is for humans, horses, and the odd obsessed mermaid—not picture-perfect butterflies. When a witch turns Ringlet into a human girl, she vows to break the foul curse, but the sole cure is to cure a prince. After stumbling across the kindhearted Prince Levin, Ringlet quickly bullies her way into his castle. There, she finds a shred of hope: Levin is also cursed, possessing a fractured soul that makes him closer to two people than one…and his other side is a chaos-seeking scoundrel.

Soon, Ringlet finds herself falling for both halves of the prince, forcing her to reexamine her witch-given mission. Should she cure Levin and return to being a perfect butterfly, or accept Levin and live with him as a human? With a witch uprising brewing in the shadows, Ringlet must navigate love, sacrifice, and the darkness lurking in every heart as she decides how her living fairytale will end.

**First 300 Words:**

To be kidnapped was a grim possibility for any butterfly, but Ringlet had assumed the culprit would be a child. A tot with a net, perhaps, gifted grace by some meddling fey. But alas: it was a witch, and a fully grown witch at that. She looked to be of an age where she could have met Ringlet’s distant, distant ancestors.

*Though, that is not much of a unit to measure by,* thought Ringlet.

“Musing about your mortality, bug?” croaked the witch to Ringlet’s cage. It was a tiny, portable prison of iron and ivy, and Ringlet had long stopped attempting to escape. 

“I am not a *bug,*” Ringlet replied. “I am a butterfly, and musing is what we butterflies do.”

“Don’t I know it,” the witch muttered. “Thoughtful yet thoughtless, you vapid bugs.”

Ringlet’s antennae twitched. “Why did you catch me, wicked witch? The sunshine was sweet on my wings, and now it is filtered through bars.” She stomped a tiny tarsus against the floor. “If only you *were* a child; you would have freed or squashed me by now.” 

The witch paused to cackle, and Ringlet wondered if she knew how stereotypically witchlike she was. 

“I want your wings for my wall,” her jailer said, swinging the cage as she strolled through the daylit wood. “I’ll grind up the rest of you to use in potions.”

“Do not lie,” said Ringlet, a frown in her airy little voice. “My wings are brown. A lovely brown with yellow dots, but a wall would still be better served by Monarch or Swallowtail. And, even if you greatly enjoyed the colour brown, I have yet to hear a tale where a witch’s brew included mashed up lepidopteran.” Ringlet made herself large in the enclosed space. “Thus, I ask again: why did you catch me?”

**Content Warnings:** Nothing major, except a bit of transformation body horror and some on-screen (on-page?) deaths.

**Timeline:** I'm hoping to start querying in September, so anytime before then if at all possible.

Their story is one of raw vulnerability, heartache, and passion set against a backdrop of addiction, mental health struggles, and the desperate fight to reclaim love and hope when everything seems lost. In the dark aftermath of disappearance and betrayal, Nya and Taliah’s bond will be pushed to its breaking point, forcing them both to face the question: can love survive when haunted by the past?

The nightmare returns—always the same, always soundless.

There I am, ten years old. Perched on our family’s stone steps, green tiles flashing like emeralds under the sun. Watching my younger self, I yell at her to run. To hide. But she doesn’t listen. She never does.

The villagers don’t hear me either. A few of the men argue. Others crouch around etched tables, fixated on marbles. The elderly sit in a circle, glancing between their empty teacups and the space where the mountains kiss the sky; its peaks sharp and curved, like the spine of a serpent.

And the women? Exactly where they always are. The kitchen.

My throat constricts as my younger self traces the dagger’s jade hilt like it’s a toy. She glances at Pa, who’s prepping supper. Then turns—catching a glimpse of Ma across the way, quietly speaking to Aunty Anh. They don’t know what’s coming, but I do.

The earth shakes. Heads snap toward the mountain. People begin to sprint, kicking up dust. The elderly and the children are quickly ushered inside by the women, while the men grab their blades. My pulse kicks in time with the warning drum as I watch Pa scoop her up, tucking her behind clay pots.

Outside, the thunder of hooves closes in. A large man, draped in animal fur, dismounts in one smooth motion. Everything about him is sharp, down to his raven eyes. He tells the villagers he’s looking for the Liu family. Says that we defected from Taido, the Kingdom west of the mountain. His soldiers draw their weapons. But he’s met with stoic silence. Not even the wind dares to move.

[Complete] [260k] [Western/Fantasy] The Arthurian Edda I: Vanguard,"Hi all! I've been working on this first instalment in a series of eight - the Arthurian Edda - for almost a decade now, and am on the hunt for an agent. However, I have very little actionable feedback on the actual thing itself, and would love to hear what **you** think! Ideally, I would love some feedback about not only the story itself, but more technical aspects, such as pacing, character engagement, tone, and worldbuilding. Ideal readers are fans of morally grey antiheroes, high stakes, messy redemption arcs, and divine weapons being stolen from the tombs of Viking god-kings. Outside of my work schedule, I spend all my free time working on my writing, and am more than available for any critique swapping! A short description of the book is as follows:

*The Arthurian Edda I: Vanguard* is a dark fantasy epic-western complete at a little over 260,000 words. Combining the grit of *The Dark Tower* with the mythic scale of Brandon Sanderson's *Stormlight Archive*, *Vanguard* kicks off an eight-book saga that reimagines Arthurian legend in a brutal, Norse god-haunted world. Travis Blake is Albion's most feared lawman and war hero. When a lightning-wielding serial killer begins carving a bloody path through the United Repulicas of America, Travis and his young protégé, Piper, are the first called to stop the slaughter, by any means necessary. But far from the carnage, charming rogue Vidoc Moreau is assembling a team of thieves, mercenaries, and killers for a different kind of mission: stealing Heimdall's sword from the tomb of a Viking god-king - a blade said to open any door, including those best left sealed. When Travis' hunt collides with Vidoc's heist, the results are catastrophic. Old magic awakens, long-buried sins claw their way back to the surface, and beasts born from nightmares roam freely. Fans of *The First Law* trilogy and *The Gentleman Bastard Sequence* will feel right at home amongst *Vanguard*'s cynical outlaws, reluctant heroes, and morally grey titans.

[Complete] [68k] [Fantasy/Adventure/Action/Mystery] Forgotten Hopes (Open to swaps),"Hello, I've been working on this novel for years. Since it turned out (very) long, I decided to publish it in parts. This is part one of the novel, called **The Deeps**.

**Type of feedback:**

Anything and everything. Mostly I want to know if you find it interesting, and whether you DNF'd at any point.

**Story Blurb:**

>**For eight hundred years, the underground city of Troqua has been besieged by elemental monsters.**

>Skye is a teenager who dreams of mounting an expedition to explore the world. He ventures into the twisting tunnels underneath Troqua, searching for magical gemstones that grow on rocky vines like fruit. If he collects enough, he'll hire a team of powerful channelers, and venture into the surface.

>One day, while exploring with his team, they stumble upon a curious scene: Troqua's protectors, the wardens, creating and controlling a fire elemental, planning to attack the city. The wardens spot them, giving chase, and Skye only escapes thanks to a magical bell that manifest from thin air. It manipulates their minds, making them forget they'd seen him. When he returns to the city, he discovers that everyone had forgotten him, and all traces of his existence had been removed.

>Armed with nothing but his bell and a determination to succeed, Skye begins his solitary mission to stop the evil wardens and reclaim his identity.

**Manuscript Status:**

I've finished the last round of edits for this part and need feedback before I change anything. 

**Swap Availability:**

I'm willing to provide feedback for a work that's <70k words. I'm not comfortable with sexual themes, and don't know how to critique them, so sorry in advance. This part is made up of 10 chapters and an interlude. We'll swap feedback on a chapter-by-chapter basis until it's finished.

[Complete] [69k] [YA Fantasy] The Wonder House,"Hello everyone,  
I'm looking for beta readers or a critique swap for my YA fantasy *The Wonder House.*

  
17-year-old Sylvia Morrow is used to skating under others' expectations for her. A less than stellar student with few friends, she struggles to see a future from herself away from her family's defunct farm. But the sanctuary of home is desecrated when a strange house falls out of the sky and into her backyard. Compelled to enter the house by magick, Sylvia and her brother, August, discover there is another world that lies beyond their own. Wonder House acts as a gateway between Earth and Nox. Nox is a land of faeries and magick, and when the siblings are inadvertently trapped inside, they must embark on a journey through a dangerous world to find their way home.

But when August is kidnapped by a faerie, Sylvia finds she must make unlikely allies to rescue her brother. As she closes in on the faerie whom she suspects orchestrated August's abduction, she struggles to confront her fear of failure, all while learning she doesn't have to do it alone.

  
With this round of feedback, I'd like to focus primarily on pacing, characterization, and dialogue. I'm interested in doing a critique swap as well. Ideally, I'd receive feedback within six weeks. Below is an excerpt of the first 300(ish) words of chapter 1. Thanks for reading!

  


Sylvia woke sharply, reality returning to her in small, bitter, and concussive pieces.

Her mouth was dry, her eyes itchy, and there was a distinct crick in her neck. One of her braids was pressing grooves into her cheek; beneath it, her pencil was digging into her arm. The fluorescent lights were beaming through her eyelids. She realized what had woken her as the obnoxious sound was repeated.

“Sylvia Morrow,” Mr. Laufman said loudly. “I won’t have students sleeping in my class. There *will* be consequences. Pack your bag – you’re going to the office.”

With a beleaguered sigh, Sylvia opened her eyes and lifted her head. She heard the snickers of her bored classmates as she shoveled her belongings back into her satchel. Avoiding eye contact even with her friend Margot, who was sitting in front of her, she ambled to the front of the classroom and took the hall pass from the accusing Laufman. She didn’t say anything as she left – she’d said sorry after the first time. She figured that pretty much covered it.

She shuffled down the empty hallway, dragging her red-booted feet, resigning herself to what lay in store for her. There was always the option of ditching school, but she hadn’t gotten that desperate yet.

Sylvia rattled her locket along its chain as she neared the office, loitering outside until the secretary noticed her through the picture windows and waved Sylvia in. Wordlessly, Sylvia slid the pink pass across the desk, and Mrs. Ross looked up at her. “You’re in luck, kiddo, she’s available.”

Sylvia didn’t need any further direction.",2,3,2025-07-21,Minute-Tension-5232,60k,1.0
