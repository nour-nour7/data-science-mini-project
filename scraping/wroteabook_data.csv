Formatting - Read This Before Posting on This Sub!,"***Please read all our rules in the sidebar!!***

Going forward, we will have a strict formatting system for posts on this sub. This will ensure the sub is easy for readers to use so they can find the books they want to read. Posts that are not formatted correctly will be removed. If your post is removed because of formatting, you are encouraged to revisit this post and try again. We all want to sell books, but like everything in life, following instructions is important. So let's get to it:

**Post flairs are mandatory** \- We now have a genre flair system. By flairing your posts, it allows readers to search our sub by genre. When selecting a flair, pick the one that best represents your book. DON'T WORRY IF IT ISN'T YOUR EXACT NICHE GENRE. Pick the genre under which your book's specific niche falls. You'll be adding your more specific niche genre in your title. The flairs just help narrow down the search for our readers. If you don't see your book's genre listed, please message the mods and tell us your genre so we can add it to our system.

**Post titles** \- Format your titles like so: ""Book Title - specific niche genre - Available on Kindle Unlimited/Vella."" (skip the last part if your book is NOT on KU or Vella)

* EX: ""Alex's Great Adventure - YA Steampunk Historical Fantasy Romance - Available on Kindle Unlimited""

**Post body** \- Post bodies should include the following: 1-3 line pitch, blurb, trope list, and trigger warnings. NOTICE THAT I DIDN'T LIST PRICE. Prices will not be listed on ANY POSTS as an incentive to buy your book. That means sales and discounts as well. The point of this sub is not to promote your sales. This is supposed to be a catalog of books available for purchase. If you listed your book here as free, but it was only free for 3 days, and a reader clicks on it two weeks later expecting it to be free, and it no longer is... you see the problem? In this sub, strive to pull your readers in with your pitches and blurbs. As authors, you should be able to do that. I have faith in you.

Art/Covers - Do not upload your covers or promotional material directly into your posts! Use [imgur.com](https://imgur.com) (or your favorite image hosting site) and include a link to your cover at the very top of your post. Feel free to use imgur to include promotional material instead of your covers, BUT only one image per post is allowed so choose wisely.

Format post bodies like so:

* Link for cover/promotional material.
* 1-3 line pitch
* blurb (this can be copied and pasted straight from your product description on whichever site you're selling your book)
* List of tropes - ex: ""enemies to lovers,"" ""chosen one,"" ""fated mates,"" etc.
* Trigger Warnings! Please, please, please include TW in your posts. They are pretty much standard practice for a reason. They protect readers from consuming material they don't want to read which also helps protect authors from negative reviews. It's a win-win.
* Link to your product. Don't forget to include your link at the bottom of the post! Universal links are encouraged but not required. Only links to product pages are allowed. No PDFs, Google Docs, etc.
* ***Do not include reviews or sample chapters in your posts!***

**Mark any NSFW material!** Erotic authors, please tag your posts appropriately.

For an example of what a properly formatted post looks like, see mine [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wroteabook/comments/onj4tu/rescue_an_adult_mm_erotic_scifi_romance_available/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

"Low, In The Valley - Historical American Fantasy - Available on Kindle Unlimited","Hello Everyone! I published my book (finally)! It came out Tuesday, September 23rd and I'm super stoked about it.

To start, here's a link to Imgur to a mood board type...thing I made to set the mood...Ooooo.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/i-did-thing-excellent-friends-weADNIs](https://imgur.com/gallery/i-did-thing-excellent-friends-weADNIs)

Here's a little about the book itself. 

**A dark fantasy western of one woman's journey across a haunted American landscape in her search for a man she knew for only one night and Hell is always right behind her.**  
  
**In the old name of Low The Kind, she will obey.**  
  
Conley Mahren did something she knew damned well not to do. She *spoke* with a fiddler of songs. A teller-of-tales. A good, goddamned liar. It was a single night that changed Conley’s life forever. Hardly for the better.  
  
But, that was seventeen years ago.  
  
The year is 1887.  
  
In Charleston, West Virginia there’s a dark and hollowed out place known to locals as the Cairns. Venturing inside that place means you’re either foolish or looking to die. Some would call Conley a fool, a devil even, but not one for easy dying. It’s never that easy. Nonetheless, Conley had been inside the Cairns, several times, in search of the fiddler she can’t seem to forget. Because for her, the Cairns were the very thing that took Pynes Oak from her arms seventeen years ago. Then his name is whispered in her ear that he’s still alive. Haunted by the memories of that one night with Pynes, Conley begins her waggish journey across a tormented American landscape to find him. Pynes may be the only one that knows the truth to what terrible thing lies sealed in the center of the Cairns, but more importantly, she just wants him to answer for leaving her behind.  
  
Everything goes to hell when a murder is committed by a figure wearing a mask she knows all too well. A mask Conley once wore.  
  
From West Virginia through the bygone lands of Vermont and beyond, Conley is joined by a reluctant troupe of companions. A retired bareknuckle pugilist with fists that once broke chains, a Bearmaiden du jour of the South, a sullied savior of the Holy Light, and a handful of former drovers with no cattle and nothing better to do wander over hills and woods as they search for the man Pynes Oak.  
  
Forces shrouded in secret are set in motion that also want Pynes to answer for venturing deep inside the Cairns and they’ll do what is necessary to stop Conley from finding him first.  
  
**“Behold a white horse, and he who sat on it was given a crown.”**

I successfully published two books!!,"Hello everyone. How is your day/afternoon/night? I took the first step and published my two books on Amazon. It took me a while, (long time) but I still did it!! I'm really happy right now! I also just wanted to share my two books here a little. 

**GODDESS OF THE EMPIRE** [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FNKV4PY7](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FNKV4PY7): It's about Aella Mayen Scarlet, a powerful girl raised by the strongest man on Earth, her master and adoptive father, Otiz Scarlet.

Her mission was to go to Oasis School to find companions who would join her on adventures through the myriads of universes looking for THE CREATOR'S 'LAST STAR'. **(Fantasy, action, elemental powers, Myth, strong female lead, and strong friends)** 

Then my second book **SEDUCTION OF A HUSBAND:** [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FRZYYXW2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FRZYYXW2)

""Seduction of a Husband"" is a romantic love story about Nuri and her husband Jo Cress. Nuri has been married to Jo for two years. However, Jo's cold personality and lack of interaction/warm made Nuri feel that he hated her and only married her because his family pressured him. On the day of the banquet, Nuri planned to give him divorce papers. But when she looked into his eyes, which were usually cold and distant he had an unusual look of vulnerability on his sculpted face. “But my love, I love you,” he said, his voice shaking with sincerity. **(ROMANCE)**

Any support, review, or feedback means the world to me, and I sincerely hope you’ll give my works a chance.

What would happen if every wish you made came true—but always had a hidden cost?,"I explored this idea in a short fantasy novella I just finished. It was fascinating to see how the main character’s life unraveled with every wish they made.

you & I - novella-in-verse,"[https://imgur.com/a/WzjiXs3](https://imgur.com/a/WzjiXs3)

How do you accept love when all you've ever known is how to brace for impact? This is a track with two sides: Side A explores heirloom pain and unrequited love. Side B is about learning how to live and love when you've been broken. It's about taking what you have and building something greater. 

For K, a young performer living shadowed by his fractured past, Side A is more than a crush, he's a lifeline in the chaotic world of stage and song. K finds comfort in his shared trauma and devotes himself to becoming Side A's harbor. He mistakes caretaking for true love, convinced being seen by Side A is all that he needs. 

But there's a misstep, Side A shows his cruel side, leaving K lost. He had thought him to be kind. K confronts his complicated feelings, trying to sort them out. Adrift, he finds an unexpected connection with Side B, a popular actor who becomes his harbor.   

Told in a poetic Side A/B structure, this novella-in-verse is an unflinching look at the love that breaks us, but also the hope that follows and the love that teaches us how to breathe again.

The Petrina Chronicles—YA SciFi—available on Kindle Unlimited,"She dreamed of exploring the galaxies . . .

Orphaned when her parents vanished in deep space, Petrina dreamed of one day piloting a ship to explore the stars for the Intergalactic Coalition of Planets.

But when she learns that her four-times-great grandfather has been trapped at the edge of a black hole for a century, she knows she has to rescue him. Family is the one missing element in her life, and her grandpa is the only family she has left.  
For the rescue, she will need to steal a starship. The one she chooses is home to Selka, an AI who isn’t thrilled with being stolen.

In journeys of adventure, danger and amazement, the youngest pilot in the Coalition Space Force takes on alien life forms from Slithones, snake-like creatures who love causing trouble; to sea-warriors in an underwater world; space pirates; a murderous Tree; lethal asteroids; ghosts inhabiting a derelict freighter; and an emotibomb ferocious enough to destroy a space station.

Whatever the challenge, Petrina and her allies are willing to run risks no one else would dare. Fans of Keith Laumer’s Retief will enjoy the escapades of Petrina and her grandpa.

Disclaimer: This book is not for everyone. My experiences as a therapist led me to write a short guide for those dealing with anxiety. It’s harsh. It’s snarky. And it’s short and to the point. Here are some samples. 

“This writing is intended not to be a cure all, a magic pill, or a new revelation. There is nothing new in this writing and it probably won’t change your life. 

So use these writings however you want. Some have suggested using this writing for fire kindling or to use it to wipe one's arse.”

“The kicker is, your limbic system struggles to differentiate between a storyline and these things actually happening. If you continue to think and engage with these thoughts, your limbic system will produce a response in some measure as if these things are actually happening. Your lying son of a bitch brain just convinced the animal part of your brain that there is an ACTUAL threat.  The storylines you are engaging with become reality to your limbic system. 

This example might seem extreme, but it’s not. There are varying degrees and intensities of storylines, but they are remarkably common and in people with anxiety they have literally practiced worrying and engaging with storylines for years and guess what…

They’ve become very good at it.”

"Published my ""librarian fights monsters"" LitRPG - academic fantasy is a thing, right?","  
Just published **Library Dungeon Crawler** and wondering if I created a subgenre or just confused everyone.

**The premise:** Grad student gets trapped in magical library where books contain literal monsters. She has to level up her librarian skills to survive and escape.

**Why I wrote it:** Spent too many years in academic libraries, figured there had to be a story there. Also wanted to prove you could have epic fantasy battles using the Dewey Decimal System.

**The process:** Started as a joke about how terrifying research can be, evolved into 444 pages of ""what if library science was an RPG class?""

**Lessons learned:**

* Research for research-based fiction is very meta
* Explaining magic systems based on actual library science is harder than it sounds
* Academic humor doesn't always translate to fantasy readers

An experimental novel that changes over time,"My latest novel ***The Ship of Theseus*** is now available on Amazon! [https://www.amazon.com/Ship-Theseus-Garry-Harper-ebook/dp/B0FNDWF28Z](https://www.amazon.com/Ship-Theseus-Garry-Harper-ebook/dp/B0FNDWF28Z)

*The Ship of Theseus* tells the story of Pablo Navarre, a successful young artist and sculptor, whose world—and his grip on reality—begin to unravel as he succumbs to an obsessive pursuit of perfection. However, the unique aspect of the novel is not the story per se, but rather in the manner that it is being written and released.

Just as Pablo chases perfection in his artwork, the novel itself will likewise continue to be refined and reimagined over time. Every few months, a new, free update to the exclusively digital release will take the place of the last. Plot points may change, characters may come and go, the very form and structure altered and experimented upon. Each version is designed to stand alone, yet together they form a living, breathing work—gradually transforming into something completely different from where it all began.

I am hoping that fans of books that play with structure and form such as Julio Cortazar's *Hopscotch*, Jennifer Egan's *A Visit from the Good Squad*, or Mark Danielewski's *House of Leaves* will enjoy this work. I have temporarily lowered the price to the $0.99 minimum to help it gain some traction—and there's certainly no better opportunity to get in from the very beginning.

Just released Book 1 of my Scandinavian romance series,"Hi everyone,

I’ve just released my first novella, *The Lake Between Us*. It’s set on Sweden’s Göta Canal, where a solitary sailor and a restless traveler meet by chance and slowly discover a love shaped by silence, water, and second chances.

It’s **$0.99 on Amazon** (also free with Kindle Unlimited): [The Lake Between Us](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPXJFXXV).

The second novella, *Between Snow and Silence*, is coming soon - set in the Kebnekaise mountains of northern Sweden, where wilderness and memory entwine in unexpected ways.

I try to write romance where the landscape is never just backdrop, but a living part of the story.

Anyone interested in a novel by an Asian woman featuring deeply flawed yet incredibly strong Asian female leads?,"Hey everyone!

I've been reflecting a lot on the power of stories that centre Asian women who aren't just one-dimensional or hyper-sexualized.  
  
Think characters who mess up, carry generational trauma, and still rise with this raw, unapologetic strength. As an Asian woman myself, I've poured my heart into my debut novel, titled How to Break a Girl, which draws from real historical contexts like Chinese Canadian immigration experiences, family dynamics across borders, and the quiet rebellions that shape our identities.

The book explores themes of resilience amid cultural displacement, inspired by the kinds of stories we don't always see in mainstream lit—flawed immigrant daughters navigating love, loss, and self-discovery. It's rooted in the history of exclusionary policies and the fight for belonging, which feels especially relevant for representation today. I wrote it to spark conversations about how these narratives can heal and empower, especially for those of us who've felt unseen.

If this resonates with you—whether you're into historical fiction, Asian diaspora tales, or just want to dive into complex female leads—I'd love to hear your thoughts. Have you read similar books that capture this vibe? Or do you have personal stories that echo these themes? Let's chat about why these stories matter and share recommendations. No pressure, just genuine curiosity and community-building!

You Tried: A Deadbeat’s Guide to Self-Actualization - Neurodivergent Self-Help Satire Non-fiction,"**Pitch:** As I was writing and editing *You Tried*, I gradually realized that much of what I used to call my ""weirdness"" was actually neurodiversity. In that way, this book became something more than I first intended. It became the book I wish had existed earlier in my life, so that I could have discovered it as a reader instead of only as its writer.

**Blurb:**

>You meant to get your life together.  
You tried to heal, hustle, journal, meditate, optimize, exfoliate your trauma, and pivot into a “better you.”

>It didn’t work. That’s okay.  
This book won’t fix you either.

>What it will do is sit beside you—softly judging, gently spiralling, and offering comfort in the form of wildly specific lists, painfully relatable quizzes, fake motivational quotes, and guided visualizations that smell faintly of existential dread.

>Part self-help parody, part emotional survival guide, You Tried traces nine deeply unnecessary “stages of personal development” from denial to weaponized mediocrity. 

>Written for anyone who’s ever cried in a grocery store, Googled “how to be okay,” or responded to a text with “LOL I’m fine,” You Tried is a deeply human meditation on doing less, spiralling with style, and calling it growth.

>This is not a guide to success.  
It’s a messy shrine to trying anyway.

**Tropes:** Fool’s Journey/Reluctant Hero, Sisyphean Task, Quest With No Treasure, Mask vs. True Face

**Trigger Warnings:** Mental health struggles, Neurodivergence, Hopelessness/existential dread, Self-deprecation, irreverent humour.

Ten years have passed since a mysterious disease wiped the earth of all plant and animal life, leaving behind a barren, silent world. Saul clings to what remains of his humanity, haunted by the choices he’s made to stay alive. Food is scarce, and desperation has turned most survivors into threats. When Saul meets Hannah, a rare ally in this unforgiving landscape, they set out together, chasing rumors of a safe haven. Together, they struggle to survive, holding tight to whatever shreds of humanity they can, even as the world around them seems to crumble. But with each step, they draw closer to a new beginning and the fragile promise of life after everything they once knew has fallen silent.

It was supposed to be a routine homicide. A body in a back alley. No witnesses. Another forgotten victim in a city that knows how to bury the truth. But Detective Marcus Cole doesn’t let things go—especially not when something feels wrong. What begins as a simple case soon leads him down a dark path of hidden networks, whispered names, and power structures built to protect the worst kind of men. As he digs deeper, Marcus finds himself crossing lines that can't be uncrossed. With pressure mounting, allies slipping away, and enemies watching from the shadows, one question remains: how far will he go to bring justice to the people the system forgot?

📚 Just launched my first book — an absurdist fantasy comedy inspired by sitcoms & magical realism,"Hey everyone,

After months of wrangling with formatting, uploads, and the usual indie chaos, I finally hit publish on my debut: Alice in Charmaland!

It’s a satirical, episodic fantasy-comedy that reads like a sitcom script collided with a magical city.

 The story follows Alice, a snarky TV actress trying to survive a retro-futuristic city powered by magic — where rival co-stars, deranged fans, rogue commercials, and even government-sponsored glitter are all part of her “day job.”

I wrote it because I’ve always loved fast-paced, surreal humor mixed with fantasy, but I couldn’t quite find a book that felt like a TV show parody in novel form. So I made one.

Not here to hard sell, just really excited to finally share it after all the hurdles. If you enjoyed The Jetsons, WandaVision, or Alice in Wonderland with an absurdist twist, you might get a kick out of it.

I just published my debut book The Calling from the Stars — a journey into cosmic mysteries and forgotten origins 🌌📖,"Hey everyone,  
After a long (and sometimes overwhelming) process, I finally hit **publish** on my debut book: *The Calling from the Stars*. 🌌📖

It’s a blend of cosmic mystery, forgotten origins, and speculative history. But more importantly, the journey to get here taught me a lot about **self-publishing**, and I thought I’d share a few lessons that might help others:

1. **Canva is a lifesaver** for creating promo graphics. I built reusable templates so I can keep marketing without going crazy.
2. **Meta Business Suite** (free) lets you schedule IG/Facebook posts — automation is everything.
3. **Proofreaders and beta readers** were game changers. What I thought was “ready” wasn’t — until other eyes caught things I’d missed.
4. **Expect the unexpected.** Formatting, cover DPI, metadata — each came with hiccups that I had to solve on the fly.

Literature & Fiction Kindle eBooks @ Amazon.com.](https://www.amazon.com/I-Am-Fascist-Cato-Avila-ebook/dp/B0FQSXRG72/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2LFAQIAUM14C6&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.COWUlkCKebRJqK1WEw5oc_WMQoC81kXeKJ5Zq6niZ0v_mLrb18PcHSFtkY0vLcTi8KEcx1QLlYneLqElTFUjLw.flJHtP_lVXqQf1yxAtFfQnJRnCAydFeqo9Gp7UQlM44&dib_tag=se&keywords=i+am+fascist+book&qid=1758163649&sprefix=%2Caps%2C135&sr=8-1)

Hey all, I have released my debut novel named ""I Am Fascist."" The book was initially inspired by Caroline Kepnes' ""You"" so, if you enjoyed that book, you may enjoy this one. I'll leave the synopsis below:

  
**A chilling psychological portrait of radicalization in modern America**

Mark is thirty-one, lonely, and increasingly convinced the world has left him behind. Working a dead-end job under a supervisor half his age, isolated from former friends, he finds solace in online forums where his resentments are validated and his grievances given meaning. When charismatic presidential candidate Thomas Crane emerges speaking the language Mark has learned in the digital underground, Mark sees his chance to finally matter.

Through Mark's own voice, *I Am Fascist* traces the psychological journey from alienation to extremism with unflinching honesty. Cato Avila crafts a disturbing but essential portrait of how fascist ideology spreads—not through dramatic conversions, but through the gradual erosion of empathy and the seductive promise of belonging and purpose.

Set against the backdrop of a fictional but familiar political campaign, the novel explores how digital echo chambers amplify ancient hatreds, how democratic systems can be manipulated from within, and how the promise of simple answers to complex problems proves irresistible to those who feel forgotten.

*I Am Fascist* is an urgent work of fiction that illuminates the mechanics of authoritarianism and the psychology of those who embrace it. Unflinching in its portrayal of extremist thinking, it serves as both warning and mirror—forcing readers to confront uncomfortable truths about the fragility of democratic norms and the human capacity for rationalization.",2,4,2025-09-18,GardenCapital8227,Adult - Contemporary Fiction,0.75
Feral Heart: A Dark Paranormal Romance (Sins of the Hybrid - Book One),"**Kate knows survival is a dirty game.** But when a night of work turns violent, she discovers a strength no human should possess - and a truth about herself that changes everything.

Now hunted by the ruthless Council, Kate is drawn into a hidden world of **vampires, werewolves, and demons**, where every choice brings her closer to a dangerous fate.

Torn between the fierce protection of a **relentless werewolf** and the dark temptation of another, Kate must decide if love is worth the risk - or if power is worth the price.

***Feral Heart*** **is a gripping dark paranormal romance filled with passion, betrayal, and supernatural intrigue.**

When the final choice comes, will Kate cling to her humanity…or unleash the feral heart within?

*It's been a long time in the making, but I put the finishing touches on Feral Heart last week and published it. I can't wait to start on the second book in the series, as there is so much more to come. Best of luck to everyone on this Reddit. Happy writing!*

The Wolf’s Hunt: Where Power Becomes Obsession 🖤,"Draft after draft, I tore this book apart and stitched it back together...chasing the perfect line, the right metaphor, the heartbeat beneath the words. I nearly gave up more times than I can admit. But isn’t that what every writer asks at some point...will anyone care?  


At last, it’s here...born from fire and doubt, sharpened by every sleepless night. A story that refuses to be gentle.

**He hunts. He conquers. He owns.**

**Julian Wolfe** isn’t a man you fall in love with. He's the ruthless CEO every whisper fears, a billionaire built of sharp edges and shadows. He doesn’t ask. He takes. And once he marks you, there’s no escape.

**Elena Hart** was supposed to be untouchable… until his obsession slipped into the open. Now she’s caught in a forbidden game of power and desire, where surrender may be her only way to survive.

Wolfe doesn’t offer love. He offers possession. Fire and ruin. Power and chains.  
This is not a love story. This is a hunt.  
And the wolf never lets his prey go.

The Last Titan Saga — Greek Myth Reborn,"The Last Titan: Unleashed is the second chapter of the saga—a relentless continuation of the journey begun in Unchained.

Where the first book forged the world and its laws, this one tests them. The gods grow restless. The hunt begins. And every choice cuts deeper than the last.

Heracles and his allies march onward—burdened by memory, bound by fate, yet determined to defy both. Along the way, they will confront ancient beasts, cursed legends, and divine wrath.

Some names you will know. Others have waited in silence to be remembered. All will bleed.

If the first book unchained the saga, this one bares its teeth.

And when the last speck of light is swallowed by shadow, you will know:

The storm is coming.

"The Woman Who Lived Backward"" — a surreal tale of time unraveling and choices that echo in reverse","I just published my new fiction book, *The Woman Who Lived Backward*. It blends **weird fiction, surrealism, and emotional allegory** — a story for readers who enjoy strange timelines and thought-provoking mysteries.

💡 **What’s it about?**  
The book follows a woman cursed (or gifted) to live her life in reverse. She wakes each day younger than the day before. Her future is already written, but her past is still uncertain. Along the way, she learns truths that others can never see — because she already knows how their lives will end. But the question haunts her: *if you could relive time in reverse, would you make peace with fate or fight it?*

🌌 **Why I wrote it:**  
I’ve always been fascinated by the flow of time. We usually see it as a river pulling us forward — but what if you were swimming against the current? This book explores regret, destiny, and the strange beauty of watching life dissolve into its beginning.

📖 **Why it’s unique:**

* It’s a short read (about 20 minutes), but it carries the weight of a full novel in miniature.
* It twists the classic “time travel” idea into something deeply personal: not machines or paradoxes, but *a single life lived in reverse*.
* It leaves space for readers to interpret it — is it fantasy, allegory, or an echo of reality?

Bones of the Voyager - An independent Graphic Novel about independent filmmaking and depression,"My wife wrote a Graphic Novel and had it illustrated by a very talented artist this past year.  It's independently published an financed; all her.  It's currently available on Amazon for $30 and will be available through other retailers and libraries soon!

The story follows a group of independent film makers working on their latest movies.  There's tensions among the group, especially with the new lighting tech who feels above it all, and especially within the director who is plagued by self doubt and depression, which is personified by a walking, talking skeleton who lives to put her down and sabotage everything.  

It's a really funny book with a heartfelt, emotional story at the core and it's told in 130 pages of beautiful full color art.  This is my wife's second published novel following her well-reviewed successful debut.

I wrote a book called Sympathy Lasagna - Adult Romantic Comedy,"**Her ex is alive. Her lie is viral. Her grief counselor is suspiciously hot and inconveniently smart.**

After a public meltdown involving a wig, a car accident, and one particularly judgmental senior citizen, 38-year-old Ari Finch makes a tiny, completely manageable, no-big-deal lie:  
She tells a grief support group that her ex-husband is dead.

It’s fine. No one will ever know. Right?

But the sympathy avalanche starts fast: casseroles, a very intense widow’s group, and Grant, the maddeningly handsome grief counselor who thinks Ari might be too emotionally stable for someone in mourning. (He’s also the one who saw the wig incident in real time. Great.)

As Ari’s fake widowhood goes viral, complete with a fake twin brother, an unfortunately recorded parking lot moment, and yes, a yoga goat, she finds herself falling for the one man who could ruin everything… or call her bluff.

But his debts to the mob keep piling up, and the only way to keep his family safe is to take on more and more dangerous jobs.

Attraction also involves marketing, and the right kind. You as the author-publisher need to plan a well-rounded launch campaign. So let's borrow a term from the tech start-up world.

The Go-To-Market Plan starts with a product. Your current product is a book, one of many perhaps. I explain how to define the right market segment, where your message intersects with their needs and desires. This market and message focus is how great books sell in the first place.",1,0,2025-09-15,powerofwords_mark2,Non-Fiction,0.67

Seventeen-year-old Ayris has never set foot beyond the domes of Ishtar.   
In this city, life isn’t measured in years — it’s measured in Points.

You’re born with one hundred. You lose one every birthday.  
Break one of the City’s laws, and you’ll lose more.

There is no way to earn them back.

Ayris is about to find out what happens when the   
last point falls, and what’s been waiting beyond the domes all along.  


**and a longer one :):**   
Seventeen-year-old Ayris has never set foot beyond the domes of Ishtar,  
a city where life isn’t measured in years—it’s measured in points. 

Everyone is born with one hundred, losing one each birthday. Break a law,  
and you’ll lose more. Lose them all, and you’re dead.

Ayris a Gray lives in Zone Two, just a step above the lowest rank.   
She dreams of climbing higher to a life with more freedom and to be with her   
best friend Stellah a Blue in Zone Three. 

But then, suddenly, she’s losing points way too fast.  
The unfairness grows, and whispers of rebellion spread through the domes. 

Will she take the risk and join the fight for freedom?  
Where will that lead her and the people she cares about?

TRAILER is out,"(you can access my book on Wattpad, inkit,Webnovel under username @yamisSilverlooom and bookname ""SECTION:ERROR""

""A law student who had no time for anything ""unnecessary"" like poetry suddenly found himself wondering what else she wrote in her notebook.""

...


She crouched to pick it up, and without looking up, muttered, ""Thanks,"" assuming he had pushed it toward her.
""I didn't,"" his voice was low, even.... detached but not uninstrested.

...

Aarav S Raichand never believed in coincidences. For him, everything had a pattern-laws, arguments, people. That's why when the same girl appeared at least thrice in the last two weeks-once in the library, once outside the cafeteria, and once at the notice board-it felt less like chance and more like something trying to disrupt his well-arranged world.

Her name, he discovered, was Aradhya Tripathi. A final-year science student, known for her unmatched grades and a habit of quoting obscure poets during presentations. Bubbly, almost too friendly, yet oddly distant when it came to boys. Aarav had noticed that she laughed easily with girls in her circle, shared notes with juniors, and even helped strangers find classrooms-but the moment a guy approached her, her words shrank to the bare minimum.

He found it curious. Not because he wanted her attention, of course. He was Aarav S Raichand, top of his batch, cold, precise, untouchable. But curiosity had always been his weakness, and aradhya was starting to look like a puzzle.

...

The first actual crossing of their paths happened in the library. Aarav had occupied his usual corner, surrounded by thick constitutional law books. Aradhya walked in with an armful of research papers, humming softly to herself. She didn't notice him at first-until one of her papers slipped, fluttering to the floor right beside his chair.

She crouched to pick it up, and without looking up, muttered, ""Thanks,"" assuming he had pushed it toward her.

""I didn't,"" Aarav's voice was low, even.

She looked up, startled, her wide eyes meeting his for the first time. ""Oh,"" she blinked, then smiled, a small, awkward smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. ""Then... thanks for not stepping on it?""

That should have been the end of it. But somehow, Aarav found himself watching as she returned to her desk. Instead of diving straight into work, she scribbled a line in the corner of her notebook before beginning her research. He caught just enough of the words to recognize it wasn't science-it was a couplet, something lyrical.

The Crossroad Child - epic adventure fantasy - Available on Kindle Unlimited,"Every crossroads is a choice… but the path was decided long before she was born.

The first in the series – an adventure in a vast fantasy world, spanning continents from the frozen wastelands to the southern deserts. A journey, meant to uncover ancient secrets and powers of the Shattered world.

  
*The world is shattered, torn apart by the forces of The Crossroad. Space itself no longer obeys the laws of creation. Beyond the threshold, chaos waits—ravenous roads stretching in all directions, devouring those who dare to stray. For those cursed with the gift, only two paths remain: serve the entities who have reshaped reality to their whims—or die.*

*Carys refuses to accept either fate. In a desperate quest to carve a third path, she steps beyond the borders of the known world and begins to question everything she thought she knew about magic.*

*Yet every choice she makes draws her deeper into a conspiracy set in motion by the new masters of the world ages before she was born.*

  
An adventure with many slow-burn intrigues to be gradually uncovered and mysteries that unfold across the entire series. Lots of powerful entities, each with their own interests and schemes. Please, mind, there is no romance plot in the book (I do not want to disappoint readers for whom it is important)

the blurb-

Tina Zaveri has everything, wealth, beauty, and power. The tabloids call her *“The devil in Hermès”*, but behind the designer armor lies a woman haunted by betrayal, loneliness, and ghosts she can’t outrun. Love, she tells herself, is for the weak.

Until the night of the accident.

When Tina wakes in the hospital, she sees the impossible: glowing golden strings tying strangers together. Lovers, husbands, wives—each bound by threads only she can see. Then she meets Dr. Aman Sharma, a man with kind eyes and a tragic past of his own. He makes her want to believe again… except no string connects them.

Her search for answers leads her to a mysterious novel, *The Fate*, whose heroine shares her curse. A story split into two parts. One in Tina’s hands. As she searches for *The Fate, Part 2*, the bookstore vanishes without a trace. And with every answer she uncovers, more questions arise.

Because some strings are meant to break.  
And some are strong enough to rewrite fate.

In Winter Clad: a High Fantasy novel,"*My second book, the sequel to my first:*



**The elves found him…**  
**…now they’re putting him to the test.**

As a life magic adept, the wizard Durndan faces his final – and most demanding – trial: tasked by the secretive and reclusive elves, he must reawaken the Heart of the Mountain, and thus disrupt the stranglehold that corrupting magic has on the human world.

Yet the Heart lies in the hostile realm of the mysterious and warlike dwarves, so he cannot hope to complete the test alone. But his once tightly-knit fellowship of companions has developed dire physical and emotional rifts: internal distrust, captivity, and loss.

How can he unite his allies and reforge their bonds of camaraderie?

Can he master his abilities in time to reawaken the Heart of the Mountain?

Or will he become a permanent fixture beneath those granite slopes, in winter clad?

The Old Asylum - Gothic Psychological Thriller,"**Cover Link:**  
[https://imgur.com/a/hnXJKTi](https://imgur.com/a/hnXJKTi)

A veteran nurse. A haunted asylum. A conspiracy that uses madness as a weapon.

John Thorne has spent a lifetime ignoring the whispers. Now, they're calling his name.

In the decaying halls of St. Jude's Asylum, veteran nurse John Thorne believes complicity is the price of survival. He does his job, keeps his head down, and pretends not to see the true depths of the suffering that seeps from the very walls of the institution.

But the arrival of Sarah, a patient whose terror feels terrifyingly familiar, shatters his routine. Her fragmented warnings about a ""doctor's smile"" and ""eyes in the walls"" force him to confront the ghost of a nurse who vanished years before: Helen Evans. Armed with a locket and a desperate, hidden note, John begins to unravel a conspiracy that goes far beyond patient neglect.

He discovers that the asylum is a laboratory, and the brilliant, respected Dr. Alistair Croft is its architect of suffering. The patients are not being treated; they are being broken, their minds systematically dismantled in the name of a monstrous form of progress. As John gets closer to the truth, he becomes the subject of Croft's most insidious experiment: a relentless campaign to convince the staff—and John himself—that he is losing his mind.

**Tropes:**  
Haunted Institution, The Conspiracy, Gaslighting, Descent into Madness, The Whistleblower, Mad Scientist, Dark Past

**Trigger Warnings:**  
This book contains scenes of psychological distress, medical procedures (including electroconvulsive therapy and restraints), gaslighting, paranoia, and institutional abuse that may be disturbing to some readers.

"Hi Reddit! I’m JP Brome, author of Unexpectedly Yours – a romance where secrets, culture, and love collide","**Hey everyone,**

I just released my debut novel *Unexpectedly Yours*, a young adult romance that asks: *what happens when the one you can’t stop thinking about is the one you’re absolutely not supposed to fall for?*

The story follows Riley Carter, a college student juggling life, love, and friendship. Everything changes when her roommate asks her for a simple favor—one that unexpectedly involves her fiancé, Yu Joon. He isn’t just anyone—he’s tied to a powerful chaebol family in Seoul. What should have been a casual request sparks a connection Riley never saw coming.

As culture, family expectations, and hidden emotions collide, Riley finds herself caught between loyalty and longing—where every choice carries a cost.

This book isn’t just about romance—it’s about the lies we keep, the friendships we risk, and the fragile line between duty and desire.

If you’re drawn to stories filled with emotional tension, cross-cultural dynamics, and a love that feels both forbidden and real, *Unexpectedly Yours* might be for you.

The Acceleration of Everything,"**Observation:** Technology adoption curves are exponential (electricity took 50 years vs iPhone 10 years vs AI <2 years). It is exhausting to keep up. How are you keeping up?  
  


**Lesson:** Exponential adaptability, not exponential learning  
  


**Action:** Build micro-learning habits (10 minutes everyday but do it consistently), use AI as amplifier, focus on timeless skills.

This post is drawn from Chapter 1 of the book, *The Future-Proof Human: How to Thrive in the Age of AI, Chaos, and Change.* If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by the pace of change, this chapter will reframe how you approach learning itself.",1,0,2025-09-10,bahmedncde,Non-Fiction,1.0

Wrote a Book after 15 years of writing - Drowned King,"They call him the Drowned King—pirate, butcher, savior.  
To some, he’s a curse carved into the tides. To others, he’s the last hope against a world rotting from the inside.

When three nobles are forced aboard his infamous ship, the **Red Wake**, they expect cruelty, chains, and a swift death. Instead, they find something far more dangerous: a man who kills without hesitation, yet wages his war by a code sharper than any blade.

Haunted by the ghosts of the drowned and driven by a debt only blood can pay, the Drowned King sails toward a fate written in storm and shadow. But as the spiral-shaped mark of an ancient terror appears in the skies, the crew must choose—follow their captain into the heart of the unknown, or be swept into the depths by something far worse than the sea.

Loyalty will be tested. Myths will bleed into truth. And the tide will not wait.

**Tropes:**

* Found family at sea
* Morally gray protagonist
* Rebels vs empire
* Memory as weapon
* Pirates with purpose
* Trauma and redemption arcs

READ ME AS MAYA

This is not a book of answers.
It is a mirror, a maze, a prayer.
You will find illusions here: some soft, some violent.
You will find longing, hunger, myth, rebel-lion, seduction.
And above all, you will find me. Maya.

Maya, the name I was given.
Maya, the woman I became.
But also maya: the Sanskrit word for illusion.
The veil between what is real and what only seems.

This book plays with that duality: the woman and the veil, the name and the myth, the self and the story.

And about the title:
The Elegance of the Prostitute.
It is neither vulgar nor erotic.

It points to a sacred archetype: the woman who holds mirrors, who offers truth at a cost, who walks between worlds, and who, even when unseen, remains sovereign, sensual, and divine.

Walk slowly. It unravels as you go. This is not a book to understand. It is a book to feel. Let it work its magic on you. Let it disturb you. Let it set something free.

**She is a doctor moving to South Africa seeking a more meaningful life. He is a hyena cast out of his clan. As darkness falls, their paths cross in a dangerous land.** 

Genevieve Marshall is a physician in a disintegrating American healthcare system. As the United States descends into chaos, she reaches out to a rural hospital in South Africa, hoping to be of help to its people. She finds lending a hand is not so simple in a country still wounded by colonialism, deep inequality, and the savage hangovers of Apartheid. Negotiating this minefield while attempting to become part of the community, she remains an outsider. After experiencing violence she grasps just how alone she is. 

Within hyena matriarchal society, males are the lowest of the low, as one young spotted hyena finds when he is exiled from the clan of his birth. Roaming an ever-shrinking wild, he is mauled by a rival hyena clan, forced to scavenge among deadly humans, each day facing death on the precarious savanna. 

Genevieve and the hyena endure vicious attacks, and in healing together they must discover a path forward: fight your way into a clan, or find a new one. A novel about a land of stark beauty and contrasts, *We Shall Endure* explores the complicated course of beginning a new life as the world around us changes irrevocably.

"My Debut Novel, Until LA, is now available.","**Some journeys change your destination.
Others change your heart.**

Nineteen-year-old Tom Bergh seems sorted—tall, good-looking, and funny, the first to help and the last to brag—the barista who pulls perfect cortados for Amsterdam tourists while his friends plan their futures with color-coded spreadsheets. But behind the easy smiles and Instagram-worthy shots, Tom’s drowning in everyone else’s certainty while he can’t even decide what to have for breakfast.

So he runs. Three months in LA. Just his camera and a half-baked plan to “find himself.”

Enter Nick: a homeless musician with a loyal dog named Ruff and a guarded smile that says more than words ever could. He survives on talent, instinct, and a quiet resilience that draws Tom closer. Nick’s world is rough around the edges, but there is beauty in its brokenness—something real that won’t let Tom go.

As Tom captures LA through his lens and Nick plays the soundtrack to their summer, their connection deepens into something neither of them expected. But summer can’t last forever. And when his return ticket starts burning a hole in his pocket, Tom is faced with a heartbreaking dilemma…

John Doe always thought his dad was bonkers—ranting about secret lizard people and a shadowy Deep State pulling the strings. Then a newspaper from another timeline lands on his doorstep, and things get… weird.

A hidden message leads him to an unlisted office with an extra-secret elevator that only has one button: Down.

At the very bottom, John discovers the Bureau of the Bizarre, the organization keeping the world blissfully unaware of the truth: **reality is kind of insane.**

Get ready to dive headfirst into cursed Victorian dolls, the Bermuda Triangle, cranky kinda-sorta vampires, double-secret lizard people that even the regular secret lizard people don’t know about, and more.

"NEW RELEASE: ""Everyday Graces: Stories of Faith in the Ordinary"" - Flash Fiction That Finds the Sacred in the Mundane","After years of writing in other genres, I'm stepping into deeply personal territory with my latest release. *Everyday Graces* is the first in a planned chapbook series exploring how the divine intersects our daily lives in unexpected ways.

**What you'll find inside:** Fifteen interconnected flash fiction pieces set in places you know—coffee shops, grocery stores, hospital waiting rooms. Each story stands alone, but together they reveal a hidden tapestry: grace arriving as interruption, love multiplying through small acts, the sacred hiding behind ordinary moments.

The flash format means you can read it in one sitting, but these stories are designed to stay with you long after you close the book.

"Just published: AI Took My Job, Now What? – My latest Kindle book","Hey everyone,

I just finished and published my latest book on Kindle: “AI Took My Job, Now What? How to survive—and thrive—in the future of tech jobs.”

This one came from a mix of personal curiosity and a lot of conversations with colleagues about how AI is changing our work. Instead of writing something heavy and overly technical, I tried to keep it light, practical, and a bit fun to read—something you can go through on a weekend and still take away ideas.

It’s available on Amazon (and free right now if you’re on Kindle Unlimited). Here’s the link: https://a.co/d/hyg5ro6

I’d really love feedback from fellow writers here:
	•	Do you usually write for a niche audience (like tech/AI people), or try to make it broader?
	•	How do you balance being informative with being entertaining?

Would appreciate any thoughts—and if anyone else here wrote something in the AI / future-of-work space, I’d love to check it out too!",0,4,2025-09-06,Clovhis,Non-Fiction,0.5

I’m excited (and a little nervous) to share my new book, ***The Book of Adam***.

It’s a short novel that explores **truth, subjectivity, and spirituality** through a modern lens. The narrative unfolds as a diary, where Adam’s reflections invite readers to question whether truth is absolute or if it shifts depending on perspective.

My inspiration came from wanting to write something that feels both **deeply personal** and **universally relatable**—a story that weaves philosophy, storytelling, and cultural threads into something that lingers after you put it down.

"The final book in my fungal horror series, Mycelial Earth!","Hey everyone,

After a long journey through the rot and ruin, I'm incredibly excited to announce the release of the final book in my fungal horror series, **Mycelial Earth**!

This is Book 3 of **The Sporefall Cycle**, a series that starts with a terrifying biological discovery and escalates into a full-blown planetary apocalypse. If you're a fan of grounded sci-fi, ecological horror, and post-apocalyptic survival with a focus on deep world-building and strong characters, this is for you.

**About the final book, Mycelial Earth:**

Eighteen years have passed since the Mycelial Tide drowned the world. Humanity clings to existence in fortified pockets on a planet that is now a single, interconnected fungal organism. The story picks up with our two main protagonists, Dr. Lena Hanson and Dr. Anjali Sharma, separated by continents but united by the fragmented knowledge they carry.

This final volume is a desperate race against time. The planetary fungal network is becoming unstable, threatening a final, extinction-level event. Lena and Anjali must unite their knowledge – ancient lore, salvaged data, and forbidden science – to find a way to restore balance. Pursued by a ruthless human faction determined to control the network's power, they must fight their way to a remote observatory for one last, desperate gambit: to broadcast a ""healing song"" to the wounded planet before it's too late. It’s a story about what comes after the end of the world, and whether humanity deserves a place in the new one.

**Links & Price:**

* **Mycelial Earth (Book 3):**  [https://www.amazon.com/Mycelial-Earth-Three-Sporefall-Cycle-ebook/dp/B0FPHNRLTR](https://www.amazon.com/Mycelial-Earth-Three-Sporefall-Cycle-ebook/dp/B0FPHNRLTR) **Price:** Kindle: $0.99 / Paperback: $4.81

I've poured a ton of research and effort into making the fungus feel like a truly alien, terrifying, and plausible planetary force, drawing on the latest theories in mycology and network intelligence. It's been an incredible journey writing this trilogy, and I'm thrilled (and a little sad!) to be sharing the conclusion.

Thanks so much for checking it out. I'd love to hear what you think if you decide to dive into the world of Mycelial Earth!

Why I Started Book Launch Lab GROUP on Goodreads,"Writing my first book was hard, but getting it noticed was even harder. I was scammed by flashy promotion sites, wasted money on campaigns that went nowhere, and found myself shouting into the echo chamber of self published authors all doing the same thing. It was discouraging and made me wonder if my book would ever reach real readers.

Through trial and error, I discovered what actually works. Honest reviews. Podcasts that welcome genuine stories. Word of mouth that grows slowly but steadily. That is how I found my audience.

I created *Book Launch Lab* on Goodreads so other first time authors do not have to stumble into the same traps. **I am not asking for money and I am not asking anyone to buy a book.** What I am asking for is an exchange of ideas. A place where we can share what really helps, what is worth the effort, and what to avoid.

Think of it as similar to the support you find in Reddit writing communities, but with a sharper focus on sharing promotional experiences and practical strategies that get books in front of readers.

Being an indie author is tough, but together we can learn from one another, rise above the noise, and find encouragement. Our stories matter, and they deserve to be read.

Sleepyhead - Thriller (sci-fa/supernatural) - Kindle Unlimited,"https://imgur.com/a/qw3ZcfU
Hello, this is my debut novel that I just added to Amazon last week. It has sold at least one copy each day, but isn't blowing the doors off anything. Just hoping to get some more eyes on it. 

""When Emi Garner dies under mysterious circumstances, her husband is left with more than grief. Their shared research into dreams—once a promising academic pursuit—now feels like a doorway into something vast and dangerous. Haunted by vivid, impossible dreams, He begins to suspect that Emi’s work did not end with her death. Clues hidden in her notes, visions that feel too real, and the shadowy attention of the NSA pull him deeper into a reality where the boundary between waking and dreaming erodes.

Following Emi’s trail, he discovers that the dreamworld is not a metaphor—it is a place. And something there already knows his name.""

Hey, everyone! Hope this is allowed here! I just published my first-ever novel, The Bunker Paradox. It takes place in my expansive multimedia ""analog horror"" universe DOMINOVERSE #1999 (abbreviated DV'99). Following the Soliatite invasion of planet Earth, a group of survivors known as the Shadow Coalition must utilize the concept of time travel and reverse the horrors brought about by the eldritch god known as ""the Light of Solatium"". This is the third and final chapter in ""The Bunker"" trilogy of projects within DV'99. It would mean the world to me if you gave it a chance.

I wish to make very clear - ABSOLUTELY NO AI WAS USED IN THE MAKING OF THIS BOOK OR ITS RESPECTIVE ARTWORK! No matter how it ages in the long run, I believe it to be quite the achievement in this day and age to say that I wrote, formatted, edited, and published this independently from the cheap likes of AI.

Our Man in Hackney – a darkly comic spy caper,"Cover: [https://finnjamesauthor.com/images/our-man-in-hackney-book.webp](https://finnjamesauthor.com/images/our-man-in-hackney-book.webp)

*When MI5 comes calling, a life in East London is turned upside down.*

**Artie isn’t a fighter. He hates confrontation.**  
**So why is he the one expected to stop an atrocity?**

As a graphic designer at a London agency, Artie Clark is used to odd briefs – but nothing quite like being asked to steal a password from a colleague.

What begins as a favour too awkward to refuse quickly spirals into something far more serious. When he’s approached by MI5, Artie begins a second life of covert encounters with dangerous extremists.

Gone is his comfortable routine of tea in his Dalston flat and nights out at the local gay bar. Suddenly, he’s navigating a world of big characters with grandiose plans, and trying to stop a monstrous plot before it’s too late.

*Our Man in Hackney* is a darkly comic crime caper that blends espionage, absurdity, and emotional depth. Perfect for fans of Mick Herron, Richard Osman or early Ben Aaronovitch, it’s a witty, warm-hearted debut with bite, exploring how ordinary people can get caught up in extraordinary situations.

*Tropes: fish out of water*

*Trigger warnings: suicide/grief, discrimination, very strong language*

Digital Marketing Metrics That Matter,"Hey everyone,

After 10 years of working in digital marketing — running more than 5,000 campaigns across 25+ industries — I finally put my biggest lessons into a book.

It took me 4 months to write, and honestly, I wish a book like this existed when I started. Back then, I was drowning in dashboards, tracking every number possible… but still had no idea what was actually driving results.

That’s why I wrote **Digital Marketing Metrics That Matter: How to Track, Analyze, and Optimize Every Stage of Your Funnel for Profitable Growth**.

It’s not a list of buzzwords or vanity KPIs. Instead, it’s a **practical playbook** that covers:

* The *essential metrics* that reveal true performance
* How to fix broken funnels by spotting problems quickly
* The “1% Gains” method that compounds small wins into massive growth
* How to calculate your break-even point so you know exactly when you’re profitable
* Business model–specific metrics (e-commerce, SaaS, local, personal brands)

I kept it simple, actionable, and filled it with case studies and templates — because I wanted to create something I would’ve loved to read years ago.

If you’re a founder, marketer, or freelancer who wants to stop guessing and start growing, you might find it useful.

Power rules the world of the Prime Mages— and I’ve been thrust into the heart of their deadly game.

My name is Isla, an ordinary mundus with no magic and no place among the elite. Yet here I am, assigned as a spy to shadow Elieason Railan, the youngest and most unpredictable Prime Mage in centuries.

I never asked for this mission. But refusal isn’t an option— not when my sister’s safety hangs in the balance. I’ll do whatever it takes to protect her, even if it means lying to a mage who could burn me to ash with a thought.

Railan watches me too closely. I need him to trust me, but also not notice me. So why won't he stay away? In a world where magi and mundi are forbidden from mixing, his attention is dangerous.

Why does part of me want it so badly?

In the futuristic solarpunk capital of New Honolulu, one megacorp is king: Island Health & Wellness. The skeletons in their closet aren’t even human. Just ask police investigator Akela Barrett, or as she’s known to Neo ‘Āina’s enemies: part of the infamous, shapeshifting Exorcist squad.

There’s just one problem.

Not only has their program been leaked, but the Chimeras themselves are being hunted. And their parent company has collared them so they can’t fight back.

Thrown into a fight for survival, Akela must use every resource available—even her nosy human partner—to protect herself and the only true family she’s ever known. Yet there’s a nagging feeling that they deserve everything that’s coming to them.

Quiet Chaos - A Lite MC Romance - Discounted to $2.99 for September!,"A bourbon distillery owner of Briggs Bourbon and the broody Prez of the Bourbon Riders. A sweet, naïve religious woman, raised in a convent. 

**Blurb:**

**He’s a tattooed Prez of a biker club, and she’s only been out of the convent for two years.**

“Have a little faith and anything’s possible.”

**SKY**

At five-years-old, I entered the convent, and at eighteen-years old, I left, realizing the sisterhood was not for me.

Wzth a place to stay, a best friend, and a good job, I believed it was only a matter of time before I met my future husband. To marry and have his babies. Unfortunately, my first boyfriend turned out to be abusive, and when I had the chance, I ran.

Then I met my beautiful hero, Cade, except he’s dripping in sin. He scoffs at my beliefs. Even so, I can’t deny Cade’s goodness or my attraction to him.

If I stick to my faith, I can win against temptation, right?

Or does God have a bigger plan that includes Cade?

**CADE**

I lost my adoptive parents, mom to cancer, and dad to alcohol. My company Briggs Bourbon is prospering along with my motorcycle club, Bourbon Riders.

There’s nothing better than a bourbon in hand and a woman on her knees… until Sky enters my life. Clad in bruises, blood, and ripped clothing, I offer her a place to stay because it’s the right thing to do.

Bible verses pour from Sky’s lips, and she gets under my skin as much as she warms my heart. This angel provokes a wickedness I’ve never felt before. She’s sweet and pure, and I promise to protect her.

When I offered to help Sky, it didn’t include becoming a husband. We’re opposites, and my ability to love died long ago… Or did it?

**Tropes:** Opposites attract, instant attraction, grumpy/sunshine, angst, possessive older MMC, naive younger FMC.

Within every page lie the ashes of history, the laments of souls, and the breath of an entire world. Here, each line is written in the blood of those who have fallen, and only those who carry patience in their hearts and a will of iron can reach the very end of the path.  
Meronica is an endless cycle: history gives birth to the world, the world gives birth to humankind, and humankind etches history once more. Whoever dares to step inside must prepare steadfast resolve and courage, for here there is no pastime—only tragedy and epic.

Last October, my wife decided she wanted to write a science fiction romance. She'd never written anything longer than a typical college paper and even that was more than a decade ago. Undeterred, she wrote 60 thousand words over a period of a couple months. I was amazed. After a few meetings with a developmental editor, she decided she didn't like the direction she'd taken, so she deleted 40 thousand of those hard-earned words.

I watched as she refined her process to ensure that the pacing felt right and the banter was funny and romantic. Eventually, she finished her first manuscript with 74 thousand words and published her book a couple weeks ago.

A few weeks ago, she showed me a draft of the first chapter of a new manuscript. I was in awe of how far she'd come since the initial draft of her first book.

Psychologist and writer,"Hello, my name is Rosa Domingo, I am a psychologist and I have found my vocation in writing. I already have more than 25 books published in Spanish and Catalan and some of them translated into English (and a few into German). 
My books are very diverse: from children's books, youth novels or meditation and personal growth books. 
My bestseller is a novel titled “Who Am I?” about a mother explaining psychology to her 12-year-old daughter. If anyone is interested in any of my books, I would be happy to make a recommendation.
Thank you very much for creating this community that allows us to talk about our books. All the best!

Finally published the political thriller that's been living in my head for 30 years,"So I'm a 54-year-old trucking company VP from Minnesota who spent three decades building and evolving this world. It started in my early 20's while on tour overseas during long D&D campaigns and mutated during late-night writing sessions of failed ideas over and over again. Finally said ""screw it"" and actually published the thing.

**What it is:** *The Architect's Legacy: The Palisade Journals* \- 5 connected novellas (each sold separately if you want) about a spy turn politician who discovers her government is processing people (think systematic dehumanization) and decides to burn it all down. But smart. Through networks and careful planning, not explosions.

**Why you might care:**

* Political thriller that doesn't treat readers like idiots
* Complex female protagonist who makes hard choices about loyalty vs justice
* Shows how resistance movements actually form (spoiler: it's messy and personal)
* Part of bigger universe but each story stands alone
* Written by someone who's worked in institutions long enough to know how they really operate

**The main character:** Nessa Kaine starts out as a loyal operative who believes in the system. Ends up as ""The Architect"" - the mastermind behind resistance networks. Watch her grow from being a piece of the system to the opposition to break that very system apart. That's the whole series.

**Where to get it:** Amazon, [ISBN 978-1968923150](https://www.amazon.com/Architects-Legacy-Palisade-Journals-Collection-ebook/dp/B0FM775N1C/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0). Search ""JT Baldwin Architect's Legacy"" and you'll find it.

**The bigger picture:** This was my learning curve to publish a book. Honestly, I have entirely too many planned books. I've got character arcs spanning decades, multiple POV series, the whole Marvel approach but with political intrigue instead of superheroes. *Reversal of Fortune* (2026) starts the next series with Peri - a thief who becomes a resistance leader.

**Real talk:** I'm not expecting this to go viral. It's dense, character-heavy, and doesn't hold your hand. But if you like stories where the personal becomes political and institutions are the real villains, then this might be your thing.

Also happy to answer questions about finally publishing after decades of ""someday I'll finish this"" or whatever. This community has been great for indie authors taking the leap.",10,2,2025-08-31,Ambitious_Sir2631,Adult - Speculative Fiction,1.0
"Lords of Night, a post-apocalyptic fantasy, available on Kindle","My first book, now back in print! 

An ancient evil worshipped as a god in the depths of time has awakened and turned the world into a desolate and dark place. The remnants of humanity are forced to take shelter where they can, hiding from the ravenous walking dead and their inhuman shepherds, the Locust People, and the Ancient Enemy’s lieutenants, the Lords of Night.  
  
In one of New York City’s underground tunnels is a young man with a secret, a growing power he can use against the seething tides of walking dead and their sadistic overseers. His name is Jack, and he has taken it as his mission to retrieve an artifact from the Ancient Enemy’s past to free the world.  
  
Jack is untested...but he has help. The last group of Special Forces operatives is on his side. With the world at stake, the team must trek through dead-infested highways from New York to Washington D.C. and back, keeping out of the watchful eye of the Lords of Night, who have sensed Jack’s presence.  
  
Surrounded on all sides by the dead and the diabolical, and with Jack’s humanity slipping away as his power grows, the team’s clock is counting down to zero and they no longer know who they can trust.  
  
Madness. Betrayal. Temptation. The last of humanity is on the brink, and it all comes down to one thing: what will Jack have to become to defeat an evil older than mankind?

"A death in Paradise, a life in Hell","Hello everyone, I'm afraid of what I've written.

A message in a bottle, where I ""vomited"" and ""bled"" onto the page.

Written in a hurry.

In barely a month, at 25.

I deconstruct my family drama until I decipher, with certainties und un certainties, my most intimate and profound thoughts.

In the world we live in?

Or sometimes in a world where we die trying to live...

The summary is as follows :

*The author engages in his own introspection. Where life is a path of duality and inexplicable paradoxes, where* ***TRUTH*** *is filled with uncertainties and* ***LIES*** *with certainties, where* ***EVIL*** *does* ***GOOD***\*, where\* ***GOOD*** *does* ***EVIL***\*. Between fundamental existential questions and an appreciation of the inner and outer worlds, everything that touches the soul. The author shares his most intimate confessions to answer questions that touch on the infinite. A revisited\* ***odyssey,*** *a spiritual work even for* ***non-believers.***

*To take a step back from our sometimes embellished, often broken lives. Where sometimes we think we are alone in the world, but where we are alone together.*

Where sometimes death is synonymous with **PARADISE**, but where life can quickly become **HELL**.

The book begins as follows :

*You know, the truth has an INCOMMENSURABLE cost.*

This cost crosses borders beyond the universe.

It distinguishes good from evil.

This price can lead to your downfall-- not to be envied by Lucifer -- but it can allow you to surpass anything that no man can imagine on Earth?

It makes you so unhappy, but it can move mountains.

It makes you so happy, but it can consume you with your moods.

In my case, revenge, hatred, and resentment were part of my heart. Resilience, self-sacrifice, and hope were the reason?

We can tell ourselves stories, but this choice determines the rest of your ENTIRE life. *I found myself between DEATH in PARADISE and LIFE in HELL.*

I think this book needs to exist.

I tell the story of my life as a survivor, and many people will be able to relate to it.

I don't just want to tell my story.

I want to help others improve their lives.

I hope that reading this will give you a little hope if your life isn't what you want it to be.

Take care of yourselves. I love you

Thanks you for reading to the end.

Crocodiles are born man-eaters.

Given the opportunity, it is the one big predator that will go for you every single time.

Two people have been killed inside a month, and now a monster croc has been captured – a hybrid – grown huge with 'hybrid-vigor' – and in the Everglades, a new and deadly invasive species – the most aggressive predator on the planet.

Authorities are baffled – where did it come from? And what else might be lurking out on the water?

But Abigail O'Neil knows.

After seventeen years, Abigail has come home – an old cabin in the deepest swamp – where all the darkest secrets lie – where monsters breed.

But even in the swamp, the most cold-blooded monsters are always human.

Chapter excerpt: A Storm in Sdubria,"Rain lashed against Jane’s cloak, each drop a stinging reminder of the storm’s fury as she urged her horse, Caleb, forward. The rhythmic pounding of hooves melded with the chaotic symphony of wind and thunder, creating a wild anthem that surged through the night. Ava, her courageous 14-year-old daughter, clung tightly behind her, a small figure dwarfed by the tempest that raged around them.

With a flick of her wrist, Jane pushed back her damp hair, revealing her expressively green eyes that sparkled with determination despite the downpour. The wind howled like a wild beast, stinging her cheeks with icy droplets and tugging at her hooded cloak. Every bolt of lightning momentarily illuminated their perilous path, a muddy ribbon winding ahead, slick and fraught with danger.

“Easy now, Caleb!” she shouted, her voice steady despite her racing heart. “We’ve faced worse than this!” She leaned forward, struggling to keep her noble steed calm as thunder cracked overhead like a cannon blast. Caleb's muscles rippled beneath her as he neighed anxiously, sensing the chaos surrounding them.

As they galloped on, the wind shrieked, piercing through the curtain of rain. Strapped securely at the side of her saddle was a lantern that flickered ominously, the flame fighting valiantly against the merciless gusts. “Stay lit, just hold on a little longer!” Jane urged under her breath, eyes locked on the feeble glow.

Suddenly, a deafening crack echoed as another lightning bolt split the sky, igniting it with electric brilliance. In that heartbeat, Ava's sharp voice cut through the din. “Mother, look out!” She pointed ahead, where the silhouette of a massive tree loomed dangerously, already tipping under the storm’s violent might.

Reacting with instinct, Jane yanked the reins, twisting her body as she steered Caleb away. The horse responded, muscles coiling, hooves digging fiercely into the ground, narrowly avoiding disaster. “Good eye, Ava!” she praised, adrenaline coursing through her veins. They swerved just in time, the tree crashing down behind them with a thunderous roar, sending branches splintering and debris flying into the night.

But their respite was fleeting. Ahead loomed the imposing gates of Sdubria, stark against the storm-ridden sky, two Bloodhemian guards stationed like sentinels, armor glimmering with authority. Jane felt her heart race anew as urgency settled in. “Keep quiet, Ava,” she whispered, tension lacing her voice. Their horse’s hooves echoed like a war drum on the sodden ground.

“Who goes there?” one of the guards called out, deep and gravelly, his gaze sharp with suspicion.

In that moment, everything hinged on their response. Jane felt the weight of their shared journey, the storm, and their anxiety pressing down upon them. With lightning reflexes, she halted the horse, guiding Ava down urgently. Seizing the reins, she navigated Caleb into a tight arc, slapping his flank with determination. The horse thundered forward, pounding against the ground as they darted away from the main road and slipped into the dense cover of the trees. The towering wall ahead loomed cloaked in shadows, while the knights turned just in time to witness their escape.

Confusion flickered across the guards’ faces as they exchanged uncertain glances. “Billy, look!” one exclaimed, raising his lantern high. The flickering light revealed a trail of muddy footprints snaking off the road—a blatant mark of their presence.

Jane pressed on, urgency propelling her as she reached the wall with Ava in tow. With swift determination, she boosted her daughter up. Ava scrambled, hands gripping the edge of the wall, muscles straining against the precipice. With a final push, Jane ascended alongside her, both of them landing quietly on the opposite side, hearts hammering in the darkness.

They moved like phantoms through the darkened streets, shadows gliding silently between sturdy houses. The air thickened with tension as they watched the knights’ torches flicker along the cobblestones, casting beams that threatened to expose them at any moment. Each time the torches passed, they pressed low against the cool stone walls, hearts beating in tandem with the echoing footsteps.

Ava’s breath was quick and shallow as she stole a glance at Jane, her eyes resolute. Just as they began to find a rhythm in their stealthy advance, a sharp tap on Jane’s shoulder shattered the silence, snapping her from her focused trance. Lowering her gaze, a chill of dread washed over her as she noticed Ava’s boots, caked in thick, dark mud—an unmistakable trace of their presence in a city that thrived on secrets and shadows. The night was far from over, and the real danger was just beginning to unfold.

"While the Kids Slept — from war, chaos, and a kitchen table to a thriving Etsy business (Free Kindle promo 8/28–8/30)","A few years ago, I left a high-stress corporate PR job after my second child. Soon after, we had to leave Israel because of the war and start over in Spain. No plan, no savings — just two kids, a laptop, and the need to survive.

Out of that came an Etsy shop I built late at night at the kitchen table. What began as survival income grew into a six-figure business that carried us through chaos and change.

I turned that journey into a book: While the Kids Slept. It’s both a story of resilience and a practical guide — about SEO, product strategy, and building a business that fits around family life.

The Kindle version is free from August 28 to August 30: [https://www.amazon.com/While-Kids-Slept-Profitable-Business-ebook/dp/B0FNWHJHH7/](https://www.amazon.com/While-Kids-Slept-Profitable-Business-ebook/dp/B0FNWHJHH7/)

If you’re interested in entrepreneurship, resilience, or just need proof that it’s possible to start from scratch — I hope my book inspires you.

I broke up with my anxiety… and turned it into a book,"Hey everyone,  

I’ve lived with anxiety and chronic pain for years. Instead of keeping it all bottled up, I started writing sarcastic “breakup letters” to my anxiety, treating it like a toxic ex I couldn’t get rid of. Eventually, those letters turned into a short book:  
Dear Anxiety, We Should Break Up.

Charity Bell’s life changes the day her daughter collapses in her arms. Desperate to save her child, she agrees to a cold bargain — marry Ian Locke, the arrogant son of a wealthy tycoon, in exchange for the money that could buy her daughter’s survival.

But from the moment she steps into his world, Ian makes her pay the price. Humiliated at the altar, mocked by strangers, and scorned by the man she now calls husband, Charity refuses to break. Until the unthinkable happens — Ian abandons her, vanishing into the arms of another woman and leaving her stranded, heartbroken, and alone in a foreign land.",1,0,2025-08-27,Open-Carry6083,Adult - Romance - Suspense,1.0

Book summary: The Innkeepers of the realm have placed a truce on Baxton Boddington Butterfield. A person of all things! After an Umbra, a demon assassin sent by an unknown master, decided to violate this truce and attempt to relieve Baxton from the burden of living, he settled on the theory that all this truce had done was put a target on his back. Baxton is forced to choose between watching his family home burn down from the inside or following the Valkyrie Brothers into a nearby realm where they will face the challenge of finding this assassin's master.

Accompanied by the enigmatic Rumor and the odd worm-man Chabot, the ill-equipped Baxton and his companions must outrun this threat while seeking refuge in a place that only reflects images of his home. With only the integrity in his heart and his friends at his side, Baxton learns of a rogue Innkeeper who puts everyone across the realms in danger.

"Reflecting on Publication + 1 Year - Notes from Star to Star, a sci-fi novella","Last year I published my first novella, *Notes from Star to Star*. Here's a bit about the first year of its life to help encourage other writers out there as well as continue my unceasing quest to promote my work.

First, I've been super happy with the response to the book. I'm giving away a lot more e-copies than I'm selling, but the story resonates with people and hundreds of readers have enjoyed it. A few months in, a reviewer in India named Abhinav posted a review that made me say ""this guy really sees me!"" Abhinav picked up on stuff like the story's ambientness and the underlying melancholy I was feeling as I wrote it. Other reviewers mentioned tiny details that resonated with them. It's so cool to connect with people all over the world like that.

*Notes* isn't perfect. The initial version went out with a ton of typos, almost all fixed by now. People read it anyway! Readers often say they want more from the story. That's good! Leave them wanting more, as they say in showbiz. It was important for me to get something done and out the door at the time, rather than continue expanding on it.

In the past year, I've seen my capacity for writing steadily and noticeably grow. That includes volume, complexity and overall facility. I'm happy with the subsequent work, some of which I've released under an alias and others which are under consideration for publication. The book marketing cycle is unbelievably drawn out, and that's frustrating. But, I’ve learned!

Setting out for the Tanami frontier, young Dalton Reid hopes to make his fortune with nothing but his horse and the last few bits in his pocket.

There’s no shortage of folks in Hensonville willing to give Reid the education he needs to survive, if he’s willing to play by their rules. Paloma Griswell’s ready to work him to the bone on her ranch. The straight and narrow is what old Marshal Rawlins expects. Bellyaching Chip Reegan just wants to put him in his place. Even Roscoe wants him to join the gang as they plan their biggest heist yet.

Faster Than the Speed of Sound: Vignettes from the Bay Area Thrash Metal Scene,"Mosh, headbang, and stage dive deep into the historical and cultural aspects of the underground thrash scene beginning circa 1982 in the San Francisco Bay Area.  This story contextualizes the nascent scene by following the antics of four main characters who actively participated in the movement while growing up within a one-mile radius of each other in the Richmond District of San Francisco.  Coming-of-age themes emerge in ghastly and comical ways.

This book traces the birth of Thrash Metal by examining the influences of the genre in great detail, including European hard rock of the 1970s and the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, or NWOBHM.  Brief histories of NWOBHM bands are featured, including bands whose fortunes were realized and many whose were not.  Juxtaposed with thrash metal’s origins is the simultaneous story of the Glam/Hair Metal scene emerging in the Los Angeles area. 

Arena and small-venue shows are discussed in detail, including important Bay Area shows instrumental in delivering novel sounds to scant groups of people.  Metallica’s early shows and the first San Francisco appearances by Slayer, Megadeth, Possessed, and Anthrax are broken down.  Local Bay Area band Exodus is featured throughout and compared to the Big 4 of Thrash.  A listening guide is included for readers who would like to explore the content further.

Pitch: This book is about the ""messy middle"" of life: compassion, boundaries, grief, randomness, and control. While it falls in the self-help category, it's a little more like an anti-self-help book. Personal, humorous, heartfelt, and reflective -- this book will help you learn more about yourself and identify ways to get un-stuck!

Tropes: no known tropes. My book is not filled with lots of ""if you do this, then your whole life will change"" kind of stuff that may be in other books. 

TW: No explicit content BUT I do talk about grief, loss, death, and some low-level mentions of the impact of trauma.

Before We Fell - YA Romance/Coming of age - 316 pages - Kindle Unlimited and select,"Hi everyone! My debut novel is officially available on Kindle Unlimited and Kindle select!

Before We Fell by Maya Lynn

*Before We Fell* is ideal for readers aged 13–18 who love emotionally-driven YA romance with strong friendships, slow-burn tension, and coming-of-age themes. Fans of *The Boys of Tommen* series by Chloe Walsh, Elle Kennedy’s *Off Campus* series, and the emotional intimacy of *Gilmore Girls* will connect with its balance of humor, heartache, and first love. The book will especially appeal to readers who enjoy found family dynamics, multi-character friend groups, and character-focused stories.

Synopsis: Milly Clark has always been held captive by her anxiety, terrified of change, and struggling to find her voice in a world that seems overwhelmingly loud and unpredictable. Starting high school—the biggest change of all—leaves her feeling more lost than ever. Her anchor through the storm is Easton Reed, her best friend since childhood, whose steady presence helps her navigate the chaos around her.

But Easton is carrying his own burdens. After his mother’s battle with cancer, he has stepped into the role of caretaker for his family, often putting their needs above his own. Milly’s calm strength is his refuge, yet when Easton finally confesses his feelings, the once-simple rhythms of their friendship shift in ways neither of them anticipated.

As Milly and Easton tentatively explore what their newfound feelings might mean, a sudden, life-altering accident forces them to face the fragility of love and the uncertain future ahead. 

Amid the scorching Arizona desert and surrounded by a close-knit group of friends, each wrestling with their own struggles. This YA romance is a poignant coming-of-age story told with laugh-out-loud banter, emotional depth, and a nostalgic sense of first love. *Before We Fell* is about the courage it takes to find your voice when everything falls apart and learning that sometimes the best kind of love is the one that’s been there all along.

This is the first book in my upcoming series, ""The Fallout Years""

Prologue

I Wasn’t Supposed to Make It This Far

I’ve been carrying ghosts longer than I’ve carried peace.
Some days I wake up and forget how heavy the silence is without my mom. Other days it knocks the wind out of me like it just happened yesterday. My dad’s gone too. They both left in different ways—one by floodwater, one by a quiet war with cancer she tried to keep from us until it was too late.

I did bad things as a kid. I’m not gonna sugarcoat that. I was wild. Angry. Mean, even. Not because I wanted to be—but because I didn’t know how else to scream, I’m hurting.

We threw eggs at houses. We stole from people who were kind to us. We did things that make my stomach turn now. My mom was still trying to survive, and we made it harder. I regret that every single day. I regret how she must’ve felt, wondering if her love wasn’t enough to make us care. I wish I could go back and tell her: I did care—I just didn’t know how to show it.

She asked us to stop smoking weed when she died. That was the one thing she wanted for us. I still haven’t stopped. I’ve been smoking since I was ten years old. I’m not proud of it. It’s just been part of my survival. Like breathing through water.

I’m turning nineteen soon, and I still don’t feel like an adult. I still feel like a kid trying to dig my way out of everything I buried to make it through.

But this book is me trying.
This is for the broken kids who had to become strong before they were ready. For the ones who still talk to the people they’ve lost like they’re in the room. For the ones who wish they could undo what they did when they didn’t know better.

This is my story. I’m not perfect. But I’m still here.
And that has to count for something.

⸻

Chapter One

The Storm Before Me

Before the grief, before the guilt, before the funerals and the regret—there was just noise.

Yelling in the background.
Laughter that always sounded just a little too sharp. Doors slamming. Feet stomping. The sound of the world never slowing down enough to hear a child cry.

My earliest memories are messy.
Not just in the physical sense—but emotionally. Everything felt like too much and not enough all at once. Some days we had dinner around the table. Other days we didn’t have a table. Or a working stove. Or a mom who could get out of bed without her heartbreak dragging behind her like a shadow.

But she tried. God, she tried. She’d let us do whatever we wanted, not because she didn’t care—but because she was terrified we’d hate her if she said no. And we took advantage of that fear. We ran wild. Fought her. Lied to her. Stole from her. She’d threaten to send us back to the system, and part of me now thinks maybe she was trying to scare us into realizing how close we were to breaking her.

We didn’t see it. Not then.
We were just kids. But we were dangerous kids. Kids from hell, if I’m being honest. People thought we were just bad—but no one asked what was broken underneath the behavior.

And at the center of it all was my mom. This exhausted, fragile woman who turned into more of a friend than a mother—not because she didn’t want to parent, but because she didn’t think she had the strength to survive being hated by her own kids. Especially after losing my dad.

We didn’t know how close to the edge she was. We thought she’d always be there, even after we pushed her to tears. Even after we made her question if we loved her at all.

Now I’d give anything just to sit with her in that chaos and say:
“I know you were hurting too.
And I’m sorry I didn’t see it.”

⸻

Chapter Two

Mom, Before the Silence

Before the cancer. Before the hospital bed. Before the whisper of goodbye ever passed her lips—there was her.

She wasn’t just a mom. She was a light. Not the kind that blazed through rooms—but the quiet kind. The kind that flickered in the dark, soft and steady, even when no one said thank you. Even when no one noticed.

She wasn’t perfect. She was tired. Worn down. She carried the weight of being mom, dad, protector, friend, survivor—all at once. But somehow, she still made space for movie nights. Family dinners. Little holidays that shouldn’t have meant much, but somehow did. We’d all pile into one room and laugh, and in those moments, it felt like maybe we were normal.

She let us stay out too late. Let us skip too many boundaries. Gave in more than she should’ve. But that was her way of showing love. She didn’t know how to be strict without losing us—and by the end, I think she feared she’d already lost too much.

She saw everything—our fights, our sneaking out, our stealing, our smoking—and she never stopped hoping we’d change. Even when it felt like we were burning everything down, she stayed close to the flames.

And the truth is… I don’t know how she did it.
I don’t know how she got up in the morning, carried herself through the day with that broken heart, watched us run wild, and still found it in herself to cook, to clean, to joke, to try.

She must’ve known she was dying. Somewhere deep down, I think she always knew. But instead of telling us, she gave us memories. Moments we didn’t deserve. Moments I didn’t even know to hold on to until they were already gone.

I remember once she said, “Y’all gonna miss me when I’m gone.”
And we laughed. Brushed it off like a joke.
But she was right.

I miss her more than anything. Not just because she’s gone—but because now I see the kind of love it took to stay that long in a world that gave her so little.

She made sure we ate.
She made sure we had somewhere to sleep—even if it wasn’t always home.
She let us be wild when maybe we needed rules.
She let us be cruel when maybe we just needed to cry.

But she stayed.

Even when the cancer came. Even when the doctors said it was too late. Even when she was skin and bones and pain, she tried to hide it behind a smile and some leftover spaghetti. She tried to protect us from watching her fade. And in the end, she left with all her secrets still folded up in her chest—never letting on just how long she’d been dying while raising us.

⸻

If I could go back…
I’d hug her longer.
I’d smoke less.
I’d talk more.
I’d tell her she was enough.
And that she didn’t have to be perfect to be loved.

Because God, I did love her.
I still do.

⸻

Chapter Three

Dad and the Creek

The creek wasn’t just water flowing quietly through the woods. For some, it’s a place heavy with questions and shadows. After that day, rumors spread like wildfire—whispers of murder, a drug deal gone wrong, people involved in something darker than anyone wanted to admit.

The stories painted a picture far more sinister than the simple truth.

But what do we really know?
The official reports said it was a drowning. No signs of a struggle, no evidence pointing to foul play. Just a tragic accident in the cold, unforgiving water of the Creek.

Still, the rumors linger. Maybe because people want answers that fit their fears. Maybe because silence breeds mystery, and a creek hidden in the woods can swallow more than just water—it can swallow the truth too.

One cop told me himself—flat out, like it was nothing—that he knew it wasn’t just an accident. He said someone was at fault. That there was a drug deal that went sideways, and hands stayed clean only because no one could speak without putting their own neck on the block. They couldn’t do anything. No evidence. No witness willing to talk. Just the creek, the cold water, and a story that got buried with him.

For me, the creek is a reminder of loss, of fragility, and of the stories we tell ourselves when the facts aren’t enough.

On paper, in black and white, it was just a drowning. A painful, real, and final end.
But I know better. And so do they.

⸻

Chapter Four

Three Times I Tried to Leave

I used to think rock bottom had a basement. And maybe it does, because I kept finding it—three times over.

The first time was after my mom died. Grief didn’t feel like sadness; it felt like free-fall. I went from living in a house where nobody really told me no, to a place full of rules, curfews, and strangers I shared blood with but nothing else. I ran away for a week, thinking maybe freedom would taste better than pain. But freedom was cold and quiet, and so I turned myself in. When they tried to send me back, I shattered. That’s when I tried to end everything. They kept me in a mental hospital for a while, a place where the walls felt softer than the world outside.

The second time came after my first real heartbreak. Three years of love, chaos, and hope tied around my high school sweetheart. He cheated after the first year, but we kept finding our way back, as if our scars fit together like puzzle pieces. Until he didn’t come back. Instead, he chose my childhood best friend—the same girl who held my hand at my mother’s bedside. Betrayal stacked itself on top of grief. My chest felt too crowded to keep breathing, so I tried to leave again. Another hospital stay, another set of fluorescent-lit nights.

The third time, heartbreak had a familiar face: his. We started talking again while he was with her, and I let hope in through the back door. When it became clear he wouldn’t pick me—or couldn’t—the weight crushed me. I did it again. He blocked me, and they kept me a week until the danger had passed, though the ache stayed.

All of this unraveled over four years, each attempt a punctuation mark in a sentence that felt too long to finish.

Funny thing is, we found our way back anyway. In February of this year, we finally stopped hurting each other long enough to start loving each other right. Now we’re together—no secrets, no side doors, no ghosts between us.

It still stings to look back at who I was in those moments, desperate to leave because staying hurt too much.
But I stayed.

And maybe that’s what survival really looks like: staying, even when every part of you wants to go.

Chapter Five

After the Edge

The hardest part wasn’t almost dying.
It was figuring out what to do after I didn’t. 
Nobody claps for you when you survive. There’s no parade, no moment where everything finally feels okay. You wake up in the same bed, in the same skin, with the same ghosts perched on your chest. The only difference is now people look at you differently—like you’re insane or begging for the attention. 

They don’t see that I’ve always been broken.

After the hospital, the world felt quieter but heavier. School halls felt too bright. Friends felt too far away. Even the people who loved me didn’t know what to say, so most of them didn’t say anything. And I didn’t care to ask. 

I got good at faking it.
I’d laugh at jokes I didn’t hear. Show up to class when my chest felt like it was caving in. Pretend my mind wasn’t replaying the same nights over and over again. I’d scroll through my phone, looking at pictures of a mom who wasn’t coming back and a boy who didn’t love me enough to stay.

Some days I’d think: maybe today I can be normal.
And most days… I was just tired. 
People talk about surviving like it’s a finish line. Like once you don’t die, you’re suddenly “better.” But surviving is just another word for living with it. Waking up with the same ache and deciding to keep breathing anyway. 
I carried guilt that stuck to my ribs. Guilt for what I did. Guilt for what I didn’t do. Guilt for still being here when she wasn’t. Some nights, it felt like my heartbeat wasn’t mine, like I’d borrowed time from someone braver.

I hurt people too. Pushed away the ones who tried to help. Pulled back the ones who hurt me because hurting felt like home. I wanted someone to stay, but I didn’t know how to let them. 
I thought getting him back would fix it. Thought love would stitch up the holes. But love doesn’t erase grief. It just gives you something to hold onto when it gets too heavy. And even then, some nights it was still too heavy.

Nobody teaches you how to keep living when you already tried to leave.
Nobody tells you that healing feels a lot like hurting, just slower. 
But every day I kept waking up.
And maybe that’s what surviving really is—not winning, not forgetting—but staying.
Even on the days you don’t know why. 
 
Chapter Six

Learning to Breathe Again

Nobody tells you that after you survive, the real work starts.

It’s not like in the movies. You don’t wake up grateful and glowing with a brand-new love for life. You wake up in the same bed, in the same body, haunted by the same ghosts — except now you can’t pretend you don’t hear them.

For a long time, living still felt like punishment.
Every morning felt heavy. I’d look in the mirror and barely recognize the girl staring back. Skin and bones and tired eyes. My ribs stuck out like I’d carved them myself. I was floating through life at 80 pounds, trying to carry grief that weighed so much more.

But something in me got tired of being empty.

It didn’t happen all at once. Healing came slow — so slow it felt like nothing was changing until suddenly, something had.

It looked like late-night drives with the windows down just to taste cold air.
It looked like eating a whole meal and not feeling sick to my stomach after.
It looked like standing on a scale and seeing the number creep from 80 to 85 to 90, until one morning it said 100 — and i felt…proud. Like maybe my body was learning to stay, too.

Some days, I still wanted to disappear.
But other days, I caught myself wanting to be kinda be here. 

I laughed, really laughed, and realized halfway through that it wasn’t fake.
I found softness in places I thought were ruined forever.
I wrote late at night — letters to my mom, words to myself, half-finished thoughts on my phone that nobody else would see. And somehow, it helped. Words made the ache feel lighter. 
I’m still messy.
I still smoke more than I should.
I still let people too close who don’t always deserve it, and push away people who probably do.
But there’s more balance now. More moments that feel calm instead of chaotic.

Grief didn’t leave. It still sleeps beside me some nights, curled up quiet and cold. But it doesn’t choke me like it used to.
And love — the real kind, the kind that stays after the storm — started to feel possible again. Even with him, after everything. Because this time, I wasn’t trying to use love to fix what was broken. I was trying to love and still fix myself, too.

My body told my story before I could.
Bones softening. Skin filling back in. A scale that no longer scared me.
From 80 pounds to 100 — not because I wanted to look better, but because my body gained its appetite. 

I still don’t know what healing really means.
Maybe it isn’t something you finish.
Maybe it’s just choosing to keep breathing, even when you remember how it felt to want to stop.
It’s forgiving yourself for every day you didn’t want to stay.
It’s letting your scars be part of you, but not all of you. 
And on the nights when the memories come back, I let them.
Because healing doesn’t mean forgetting.
It means learning to carry it — and live anyway.

I’m not whole. Maybe I never will be.
But I’m softer. Stronger. Heavier, even.
And for the first time in a long time, that feels like something worth staying for.

I’m an indie author and I just published When Crowns Draw Blood, an adult epic fantasy about power, betrayal, and a magic older than the thrones that try to bind it.

**An epic fantasy series where storms aren’t just weather—they’re war.**

In a world fractured by elemental forces and ancient betrayals, four young heroes must rise from the wreckage to confront powers that threaten to consume everything. From wind-swept coastlines to shadowed kingdoms, *The Hurricane Chronicles* sweeps readers into a richly imagined realm where loyalty is tested, truth is dangerous, and courage might be the only thing left standing.

This **completed four-book saga** features the following tropes:

\- Found Family – Bonds forged in battle, deeper than blood.

\- Coming of Age Through Chaos – Growth through storms, both literal and emotional.

\- Hidden Powers – Abilities that awaken under pressure, often feared or misunderstood.

\- Elemental Magic System – Wind, water, and storm as forces of both creation and destruction.

\- Ancient Prophecy (with a twist) – Not everything foretold is true… or complete.

\- Epic Final Battle – Stakes that shake the world.

\- Series That Actually Ends – No cliffhangers. Just a satisfying, earned conclusion.

Whether you're a teen devouring your next fantasy obsession or an adult reader craving a story with heart and high stakes, *The Hurricane Chronicles* offers a storm worth chasing.

Wrote My First Book,"(Sappy Backstory Incoming): Since I was young I have always dreamed up movie plots in my head. Stories that I thought were OKAY. Long story short - I decided to write as a way of expressing these ideas onto paper. This is my first book, and by no means screams 'Great' or even 'Good'. Appreciate any feedback that I can get, as this in turn will help me with my second book.

I got one unwritten review so far - 3/5, which I was happy with. I feel like that is generous considering this is my first novel.

(Dark Fantasy Adventure) The Price of Immortality - by Brian Long,"I did it! It took 3.7 years and $6000 in editing costs, but we’re there! 

My first Dark Fantasy adventure novel (and 1st novel at all) is now live on Amazon and Kindle Unlimited! 

The Price of Immortality by Brian Long is an adventure that takes place in its own unique world, with unique monsters and a pretty unique premise! Humanity was at the peak of science and in a modern world similar to our own before the Ethereals (researchers) attempt to use the magical metal “Runite” to extend human lifespans. This causes a massive upheaval in society and the Scourge Wars took place, leading to the collapse of all things advanced and comfortable. 

The story of Brin, Blanchessa, and Saeris takes place nearly a thousand years later in a tiny mountain village that is protected by nothing more than the magical runite barrier that surrounds the village. The undead horg roam the wilderness and everybody and everything exists to serve Phoebe, the goddess of light and the supposed “savior” of humanity from The Scourge Wars that had brought mankind to its knees. 

Early reviews have been great and feedback has been so positive, I hope you’ll give this a shot. I’m already diving headfirst into the second book!

If you're a fantasy fan looking for an afternoon read, my new novella may be the perfect fit for you! It's a story of revenge, and the way people can justify their actions if they think they're doing the right thing overall.

Blurb: Is the greater good worth losing yourself for?

Forced to live in hiding from people who would seek to make her a living weapon, Serennia has learned the hard way that good things are temporary. When she flees her abusive household and strikes out on her own, she finds herself in a cruel, unforgiving city that would be happy to tear her apart. Knowing that safety comes in numbers, she throws her lot in with the Sparrows, an underground network of thieves whose doors are always open to the willing. But her abilities can't stay hidden forever, and when the truth comes out she'll find herself torn between staying true to how she was raised, or doing whatever it takes to make the city a better place.

Fear dopes you up or drives you—wield it like a blade and swing forever. In Fear of Loss: The Opiate that Owns You, discover 13 battle-tested tools to conquer fear of loss (FOL), the numbing force that keeps you small in negotiations, career, and life. Blending David Goggins’ raw intensity with Dalai Lama’s calm wisdom, this book rewires your brain to turn fear into fuel. From spotting FOL’s flinch (Flinch Finder) to flipping it into action (FOL Flip) and adapting to chaos (Flex Fighter), you’ll master fear to outsmart rivals like Jake the sales rep in high-stakes deals and chase bold dreams. Backed by science (Psychological Science, 2020–2022), these tools boost resilience by 30–40% and negotiation wins by 20–30%. With vivid stories, like Sofia’s $475K deal, and a no-BS style, this 168-page guide is for “simple humans” ready to fight.

The Destroyer,"""This unflinching collection of poems plunges into the abyss of love, loss, and self-destruction with a jagged, unapologetic voice. Through a haze of addiction, longing, and fractured romance, The Destroyer unearths the beauty and brutality of a soul unraveling—each line a confession, a scream, or a fleeting grasp at redemption. With stark imagery and relentless rhythm, it explores the wreckage of human connection, the weight of fame, and the haunting pull of oblivion, offering readers a front-row seat to a mind at war with itself. For those drawn to the dark, the tender, and the untamed, this book is a visceral odyssey through the chaos of existence.""

Cassidy Sutton built her life on deception. Slipping through towns, charming the unsuspecting, and vanishing before anyone could ask questions. Her beauty is disarming. Her wit, lethal. But one mistake changes everything. She thought she’d never see Harry Steele again; the wealthy miner she drugged and robbed before disappearing into the night. But Harry isn’t like other men. He doesn’t just want his gold back... he wants her. When he tracks her down on a westbound train, Cassidy is offered a choice: face the hangman’s noose, or repay her debt by working off her crimes on his remote family ranch. 

With nowhere left to run, she agrees... Only to find herself tangled in a slow-burning war of pride, secrets, and unexpected desire. As Harry and Cassidy clash under the blazing sun and the weight of their shared past, something dangerous brews between them. Because the man Cassidy once tricked might be the only one who truly sees her, and she’s not sure if that makes him her salvation... or her greatest threat. But Cassidy’s past isn't done with her.

As secrets unravel and reality warps under the influence of drink and deceit, Daniel is plunged into a disorienting spiral of horror and self-discovery.

"2nd entry of ""Everything the Light Touches"" released today","The 2nd entry in my ""Everything the Light Touches"" saga just went live on Amazon/Kindle today, and is titled ""Everything the Light Touches: Secrets of Ar'Kaeyen"".

The land is racing towards violence once again, as one faction is no longer content with simply oppressing others. Join our heroes as they continue their journey to learn the secrets of the past, and if a new great war can be averted. But what secrets could there even be when it comes to Gods and mortals?

**Book Description:**

The world of Galamud teeters on the precipice of violence once again, with the threat of genocide looming on the horizon. Our unlikely heroes journey throughout the danger-filled Shadowlands to find the answers to save the continent from a potential future that is soaked in blood. The ancient city of Ar'Kaeyen, once a utopia filled with the many races of the world living in harmony, now lies abandoned on the far reaches of the continent. If coexistence was possible in the distant past, then there must be answers found within the hallowed walls of the derelict city that can simmer the current rising tensions.  
  
An abundance of perils lie in wait, threatening the very mission to save the continent and its inhabitants. Undiscovered beasts, dangers from below the surface, and even the power of gods threaten to impede our heroes. Will the odd collection of humans and demihumans have the gumption and ability to successfully traverse the lands, and will they find what they are looking for in the ancient city of Ar'Kaeyen? Or will their aspirations crumble away along with the decaying remains of the city?

"Hello, everyone. I wrote a collection of poetry","I'd like to promote my collection of poetry that's recently been out, titled

[The Slate Blue Eyed Hawk](https://www.amazon.in/dp/9370023593)

Here's a synopsis

""This book consists of 32 poems celebrating the majesty, the splendour and the keen astuteness usually associated with the hawk; not to mention the rush of wind one can drown themselves in upon considering the freedom analogous to the bird. Romans and Greeks sing of the hawk's flight bearing shafts of Jupiter's and Zeus' thunder on its back; while ancient Scandinavian bards pen verses of the wise and agile passerine's travels across the nine realms branching out from the world tree, Yggdrasil. The Japanese pay homage to the hawk as a harbinger of good fortune and prosperity; while the Egyptians venerate the feathered creature as the deity of the all-encompassing sky, Horus. In this collection, I have sought to paint a stitched mural of the hawk using metaphors and allegories to convey the various aspects of liberation linked to the brown bird with its slate-blue and sharp eyes; protection, conservation, refuge, preservation, auspices, guidance, championship and providence. I believe this is my love letter to the beautiful creature of the air."" -Dibyasree Nandy.

I wrote a gothic horror novella,"Hi I’m John Morris II, and I’m 19 years old. I’ve been obsessed with making stories for as long as I can remember, and horror since I was 9.

Last year, while traveling for work as a driller’s assistant, I started writing my first story I planned to release. I worked non stop perfecting the writing and editing nearly the whole time. 

Then, four months ago, all that work became my first gothic horror novella: Harmony Nights.

Betty Hangrove and her sister, Mary Baker, are heading to Harmony Cemetery to visit Betty's late husband, Kenny Hangrove. Suddenly, a violent crash ends their quiet journey, and propels Betty into an existential nightmare.

When she comes to, she's injured, cold, and utterly alone. With the car totaled, and Mary missing, Betty is stranded, and now must search the moonlit grounds for her lost sister.

As she goes about the endless graveyard, she continually encounters twisted echoes of people she once knew, who had long since passed.

Orkin are manufactured interconnections of humans, pigs and bears (orc and pork have the same root!) - they may be big, smelly, fast breeding and overrun with emotions - but... they aspire to be better. They want to be free. They have had a lot of bad press, but they aren't bad people.  
The humans are descended from kidnapped Irish people (the elves are Tuath, fae folk of ancient Irish legend). Humand of Tír live under draconian laws that dictate even who they can and cannot mate with, enforced without mercy and through brutal and severe punishments.

Except the new humans, the ones from 21st century Earth. The ones with Army Ranger training, submachine guns, sniper rifles, high explosives, drones, etc. They level the odds, change the game. They will help the orkin and humans rebel against slavery.

I wrote a paranormal thriller that’s as much about memory and grief as it is about ghosts and here’s why!,"I just released my new book, *A Wake of Shadows*, and I wanted to share a little about why I wrote it.

On the surface, it’s the story of Caroline, a woman who inherits an older home in VA from a relative she never knew. She moves in hoping for a fresh start, but the house has other plans. It offers her comfort, companionship, and peace—but only if she gives it something in return. The question becomes: how much of yourself would you trade to stop feeling pain?

I wrote this because I’ve always been fascinated by the idea that a haunting doesn’t have to be about rattling chains and blood on the walls; sometimes the most dangerous ghosts are the ones you *want* to keep around because they make you feel safe.

The house in this story is a predator, yes, but it’s also a mirror. It knows your secrets, your grief, your private fears… and it uses them to convince you it’s the only place you belong. Writing it was cathartic for me—pulling from my own experiences with emotional manipulation, memory, and the quiet seduction of letting go when life gets heavy.

If you enjoy:

Atmospheric, slow-burn suspense, Gothic settings with modern characters, stories where you can’t trust what’s real, endings that linger in your head long after you close the book: then *A Wake of Shadows* might be your kind of haunting.

It’s available now on Amazon and free with Kindle Unlimited!  I’d love to hear your thoughts!!

For those who’ve been told to be strong, obedient, or perfect — but have found that being truly yourself sometimes means breaking the very rules you grew up believing in.

At its heart, this story is about the courage it takes to grow beyond what you’ve been taught. It’s about the painful, messy, and beautiful process of unlearning the things that hold you back.

It’s also about love — not just romantic love, but the kind that cracks you open, changes how you see the world, and makes you want to fight for something bigger than yourself.

And ultimately, it’s about making the hardest choice of all: choosing yourself, even when it costs you comfort, relationships, or the life you thought you were supposed to live.

If you’ve ever stood at that crossroads, torn between who you were told to be and who you are — this story is for you.

Right now (from the 8th - 10th) it's on sale for 0.99 on amazon, otherwise it's free on KU.

Regardless, this book means the world for me. I would love to connect with fellow authors, and would love to have someone to spar with and possible get a critique partner for my WIP. I am also always looking for feedback (cover, blurb or the story itself if you do give it a try)❤️",0,2,2025-08-09,Sea_Library_8798,YA - Romance - LGBTQ,0.5

"Jack Pizza, Boy Detective + LA = Messy","Hi everyone, I recently published my first book on Amazon, check it out if you like:). It’s kind of a mythopoetic noir mashup.  I basically write what I want to read, genres be damned.  Genres in the stew:  horror, folklore, satire, absurdism, (hopefully) dark comedy.  Kind of like if Kafka thought he was funny and was into Noir, written by Asimov instead of Chandler, and was really into mythology, folklore, reality tv, and owned a Venture Bros boxed dvd set.  Yeah, anyway, here’s my blurb.

Jack Pizza thought he’d seen it all back in Chicago.
Haunted Trapper Keepers. Al Capone’s ghost. A Sasquatch in a Bulls jersey.
But that was before tonight.

Now there’s a dead cartoon character face-down in the swankiest restaurant in West Hollywood. There are reality TV stars with blood under their nails, creatures that want to wear your face, and a Pez dispenser that might be a god, or a warning.

Things spiral fast.
And Jack Pizza, Boy Detective?
He’s not sure anyone can be saved. Not even him.

A sacred absurdist fever dream of metaphysical noir, grief horror, and deadpan comedy.
Jack Pizza, Boy Detective, Lítost, Baby! is what happens when childhood trauma puts on a trench coat and investigates itself.
It’s mythpunk for the emotionally unwell.
Weird, tender, feral.
Like if Calvin & Hobbes got possessed by The Book of Job.

Life looked a bit different in 2009,"# [1. Getting Started (What's on the menu?)]()

# [1.1 A preface to the preface]()

Life looked a bit different in 2009. As a young pediatrician, I felt like the king of the world. I was about to start my second residency in infectious diseases and thought I was invincible.

Then came that phone call. It wasn't even meant for me.

The call was between Prof. P.Y. and Prof. D.G. At its core was P.Y.'s need to find a replacement lecturer for the parasitology course for second-year medical students, due to Prof. Y.A.'s imminent retirement. P.Y., who was then the head of the medical school, saw he was in trouble and immediately called the least suitable person for the task. He knew very well that D.G. was lazy and knew nothing about parasites, but he also knew very well that he could impose anything he wanted on D.G., and D.G. had no means of resistance.

I was casually passing through the corridor next to D.G.'s room, where I constantly hung out. A silly smile on my lips and a deep need to read another 500 unnecessary pages in Feigin or Mandell (the textbooks for infectious diseases in children and adults, respectively). I had no idea how my life was about to change completely.

I could hear snippets of the conversation. It was clear D.G. was in distress, and the hundred-kilo hammer on his head was causing him slight discomfort. Then the unbelievable happened. Deus ex machina. D.G. spotted my clumsy figure dancing in the hallway and immediately jumped up – ""Shalom, you have a phone call."" The idiot that is me immediately replied, ""No problem,"" took the receiver, and brought it to my ear. ""Yes, P.Y., what's up?"" The end.

I won't bore you with the details. P.Y. commanded me, in the most polite and friendly tone he could muster, to attend a meeting with Y.A. in the parasitology lab to replace him in delivering the course in question.

A week later, I was walking happily and light-heartedly, with septol in my eye (don't ask) that made me grimace and look like a pervert, on my way to the pathology building. On the second floor, in the parasitology lab, Prof. Y.A. was waiting for me.

It's worth understanding a few basic things about the situation at that time:

* I have just finished my pediatrics residency. My knowledge of parasitology was close to zero and included memories of missing a class or two due to military reserve duty and my father's memorial service. That's it.
* Parasites sounded to me like something related to bizarre jungle diseases. Something with swollen testicles and terrifying pictures of worms peeking out of all sorts of holes and orifices in the body. (Yes, I know I was stupid, and I hope it's mostly passed).
* Prof. Y.A. didn't know me at all, certainly didn't remember me from my student days (a grade of 85 in the course, thanks for asking).
* My professional aspirations were limited to completing my infectious diseases residency; I was happy to be the youngest and most enthusiastic in the group.
* I had no teaching experience at all and only a vague idea in my head of what I wanted to say in the conversation.

I entered the room. Y.A. offered me coffee. I refused. He tried to understand why I was twitching as if suffering from St. Vitus' Dance. I didn't have the energy or desire to explain to him that I had gotten septol (alcohol-based hand sanitizer) in my eye a few minutes ago in the ward, while washing my hands for the thousandth time that morning, as usual.

He got straight to the point and immediately surprised me. Yes, of course, he needed me to teach the course. But that wasn't the main thing. Before his retirement, the sleepy Iraqi realized he hadn't secured a successor for managing the parasitology lab. In fact, he had found a successor, Dr. D., but had a fight with him a few weeks before the end. Now he dropped the bombshell and asked me to take over the lab management. I chuckled, contorted, grimaced, didn't understand. What did that have to do with me, for God's sake?!

I had never considered a career in a lab. After all, I was a clinician burdened with shifts and sleepless nights filled with resuscitations and hallucinations. What did I have to do with this?!

I explained that it wouldn't happen, but gladly (a blatant lie, but I tried to minimize damage and retreat quickly) I would teach the course starting next year. The conversation quickly died down; one could see the light fade from Y.A.'s face and his enthusiasm vanish. We quickly agreed on a course outline, he handed me some files, and we parted ways.

Since then, I have been teaching the parasitology course every year with great enthusiasm, both mine and the students. This book summarizes the course as it is – a rollercoaster ride of dubious science (all my knowledge comes from self-study), eternal stand-up shows (I have a need to make people laugh in lectures, otherwise I get bored), and countless experiences with parasites. I learned to love the profession, the patients, and yes, even the parasites. They are my closest friends. I try to know everything about them, to laugh at them, to understand them, and to successfully kill them. All out of mutual respect for these repulsive creatures.

I'm sure you'll find interest in the crazy journey you're about to embark on. Parasitology is fascinating. The most fascinating of all. Believe me.

And as for Y.A.'s offer to manage the lab? In retrospect, the best offer I ever received. I regret not taking it in real-time.

El Heredero de la Siberia sin Magia,"This past week was the culmination of a decades-long journey that started when I was a child. I finally published my fantasy book that I have been working on since the original draft I wrote as a child. It is an incredible feeling to know that I was able to fulfil my dream of getting published, and now I cannot wait to share my story with everyone.

My fantasy book, titled ""El Heredero de la Siberia sin Magia,"" is written in Spanish and centers around the journeys of three protagonists: a prince without a kingdom, a princess without love, and a captain without a past.

For those of you who do speak Spanish, here is a brief synopsis ;)

>Leonard Dupeyeard, el príncipe del único país que no cree en la magia, ha fracasado como líder y el pueblo lo detesta. Hijo de un adorado rey desaparecido en la guerra, y de una reina que lo abandonó cuando era un niño, nadie lo preparó para gobernar. Siberia se desmorona y una traición familiar lo obliga a escapar para salvar su vida.

>Pero lo que comienza como un castigo, se convierte en una aventura hacia lo desconocido. Cuando Leonard se cruza con una princesa que huye de un matrimonio por conveniencia, y un capitán que no recuerda nada de su pasado, pronto descubrirá que la magia no solo existe, sino que guarda un vínculo especial con él.

>Brujas, romance, viajes en el tiempo, demonios y una maldición que parece un tesoro, son solo el comienzo de un viaje de autodescubrimiento, redención y giros inesperados, en el que el destino y la muerte son personas, y las reglas estrictas de una sociedad en agonía tienen una razón oscura de ser...

>A veces, cuando todo parece perdido... es cuando empieza lo real.

Mon Coeur,"Hi Everyone,
 
New Author here. My Name is Amber Specht, and I'm excited to announce that I have written a paranormal romance set in the small town of Dubuque, Iowa. For anyone interested, below you will find the back of my book, Mon Coeur, as well as the link.
 
Thanks!
 
 It was hard to believe that the man of my dreams sealed my fate.
Gabriel had transformed into a nightmare—a monster.
A vampire?
 
Influenced by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Poem ""Evangeline."" Mon Coeur tells a story of love, self-discovery, and that sometimes the bonds that tie us aren't always by blood. Set in Dubuque, Iowa, the story follows Paige, who at just nine years old stumbles upon a mysterious man hidden in her grandmother's woods, who captivates her with the enchanting tale of Gabriel and Evangeline. Following that fateful encounter, Paige began having dreams of Gabriel and Evangeline. As Paige ages, she feels deeply connected to Evangeline and can see herself in her, making these dreams feel less like dreams and more like lost memories. The story unfolds from there as hidden truths come to light. Paige discovers she possesses remarkable powers. She reconnects with a past lover, and along the way, she learns to harness her newfound abilities in a desperate attempt to rescue what she thought was once lost.

Erotic Bed Time Stories - Female written Erotica - Available on Kindle,"Wonderful souls! I just published **my first book**. It's a spicy short story collection on a mission: Making consent and safer sex sexy. 

  
I hope some of you will give it a read and enjoy it. This is the forward by a dear friend and passionate woman wrote: 

  
There’s something powerful about letting our minds wander into fantasy. When we read erotic stories, we’re not just escaping, we’re awakening. Heat, curiosity, arousal, empathy, imagination. Our brains light up with dopamine and oxytocin, our bodies respond, and we get to explore our desires without consequence or pressure. Fantasies give us freedom. Permission. And sometimes, clarity of our own needs and boundaries.

Julie’s stories do exactly that. Her words play to your senses. Drawing you in, making it easy to feel the heat and the tension. There’s a perfect balance between sexy foreplay and release. But what makes this collection truly unique is how Julie naturally includes consent and safe sex in her stories. It brings the fantasy closer to reality, in the best possible way.

Inside are five stories, each with its own energy. And honestly, it’s hard to pick my favorite. Like different encounters in life, each one brings out something distinct, an energy meant to be. The characters shift, the dynamics evolve, and so do we - as readers, as women, as sensual beings.

You’re in for a slow, delicious burn. Enjoy it 🔥

"""Half Pant Memories"" - Memoirs and Biographies (also for children) - Available in Kindle Unlimited","**Relive the laughter, wonder, and heartfelt moments**  **of a boyhood in half pants.**

**Description:**   
Step into the heart of rural Tamil Nadu (India) in the 1960s, seen through the wide-eyed wonder of a happy-go-lucky middle-class boy. Half Pant Memories is a vibrant collection of 33 nostalgic, humorous, and culturally rich stories drawn from real-life events during the author’s childhood years of 4 to 15.   
  
Known for his keen eye and reflective nature even as a child, the author recalls scenes, people, and experiences with remarkable clarity. Told with wit, sharp detail, and a matter-of-fact style, these stories chronicle life in a Tamil village near a small town in Thanjavur district —  a time of steam engines, village festivals, vegetable gardens, home remedies, boyhood fears, and unforgettable characters like schoolteachers, cooks, goldsmiths, and traveling drama troupes. There are no heroics here — just a curious, lovable last-born son of a schoolteacher, making sense of life as it unfolds around him.

The stories follow a unique narrative blend. Interesting and immersive memories from the child’s point of view are interwoven with occasional reflections from the adult narrator — allowing readers to enjoy both the innocence of the moment and the cultural or emotional depth beneath it. Throughout, readers also gain glimpses into the customs, beliefs, and lifestyle of rural Tamil Nadu in a pre-digital, pre-globalized era.

Whether it's getting lost in a crowd, watching trains with wide-eyed fascination, trying to master street games, encountering thieves, or navigating the world of school friends and siblings, these tales radiate the innocent magic of a childhood long gone — yet warmly familiar.

The book is enriched with charming black-and-white cartoon-style illustrations — at least one for each chapter — that visually bring to life the era and the emotions behind each story.  
  
**About the Author:**  C.V. Rajan is a retired engineer, ex-design consultant, and long-time writer in both Tamil and English. A former contributor to popular Tamil magazines under the pen name Sandeepika, he is also a spiritual seeker now residing at Amritapuri Ashram in Kerala under the holy feet of Mata Amritanandamayi Devi (Amma).

To disappear she’s dyed her hair, run from her hometown, and taken up cheating at poker to make ends meet without leaving a paper trail. With the assistance of a disembodied guide she calls Voice, she’s managed to stay one step ahead of the monsters that killed her family.

Now that Rivers has her, he won’t stop until she has opened the world for him.

But Prim doesn’t take well to being captured, and eventually Rivers is forced to strike a deal that turns her from captive to partner: she’ll stop making his life miserable and help him get back his powers, and he’ll help solve her family’s murder.

Trials of the Lost Soul - Dark Fantasy Romance / Paranormal - Available on Kindle Unlimited,"[https://imgur.com/a/QIUiDHk](https://imgur.com/a/QIUiDHk) 

**Pitch**  
Mary was supposed to die with her sister in her arms. Instead, she awakens in a realm of the damned, separated from the only family she has left. Her only hope of saving her sister’s soul is to survive the Seven Trials, each one a different realm testing the very core of who she is.

**Blurb**  
Mary’s story should have ended the night she died. Instead, she awakens in a strange and punishing afterlife, a realm where the condemned are sent to suffer for their sins. Torn away from her sister by those who judged their souls, Mary learns there is only one way to challenge this judgment: survive the Seven Trials of the Soul.

Each trial is its own unforgiving realm, a battle of mind, body, and soul. From sacrifice to mercy, from endurance to the will to survive, every test is designed to push her past her limits and prove her unworthy of redemption. Fail, and she will be trapped here forever. Succeed, and her sister’s soul will be saved.

Two beings follow her every step:  
Azel — an angel who tries to shield her but hides a dark truth.  
Valerio — a demon who treats her struggle like a cruel game, waiting for the moment her resolve shatters.

In a world where loyalty can be a weapon and trust a dangerous gamble, Mary must decide how much of herself she is willing to risk. The trials will push her beyond her limits, and the cost of failure is everything she has left to fight for.

The death of his sister still plagues Jack's mind as he continues towards the heart of the land in search of answers. Along the way, he meets a fellow lone traveler named Reila. Together, they slowly uncover the island's secrets. But each new discovery leaves more questions than answers. Reila herself is an enigma that Jack cannot quite unpack. All paths lead to the Valley of Desolation, where the island's past has been hidden away, dormant waiting to erupt, with explosive consequences for our adventures.

The Clock Forgets Me - Literary Magical Realism,"**What if time wasn't just slipping away—but actively refusing to remember you? An eighty-two-year-old widow discovers her reality isn't unraveling from dementia, but from time itself skipping forward without her.**

**BLURB:** Eileen Hart, an 82-year-old widow in rural Wisconsin, begins to lose time—not through forgetfulness, but through the world's refusal to remember with her. Her kitchen clock skips hours. Neighbors reference events she hasn't lived. A man she doesn't recognize claims to be her son. Then, a future-dated obituary arrives by post.

Reality isn't slipping away—it's skipping ahead.

As everyday objects become unreliable narrators—clocks showing impossible hours, mirrors reflecting movements before they happen, photographs changing their contents—Eileen must navigate a landscape where memory itself has become negotiable. When her supposedly dead husband appears in a hospital room to help her remember a son she never knew she had, Eileen faces an impossible choice: accept this new reality where time moves differently, or retreat into the safety of forgetting.

In this haunting exploration of grief, memory, and the nature of time, Eileen discovers that some truths exist beyond linear experience—and that love might be the only constant in a world where even clocks can forget.

**TROPES:**

* Unreliable reality
* Hidden family secrets
* Time distortion
* Elderly protagonist with agency
* Magical realism in everyday settings
* Parallel timelines
* Memory as fallible narrator

**TRIGGER WARNINGS:**

* Themes of dementia and cognitive decline
* Grief and loss
* Death of spouse (past)
* Medical settings
* Discussions of aging and mortality
* Existential themes

**Pitch**: It's a young adult epic fantasy with steampunk elements, with a quest to end a world-spanning environmental threat. Think airships running on steam and mana, flying cities and the like. It's the first book in what will be a 5-book series, and the next two books are already written.

**Blurb:**

*When the world is ending, what do you do with your time?*

For Maeryn, the answer is simple: you find a solution.  
The surface of the world is shrouded in a deadly, mutative Mist—and it's spreading. Mana, the magical force keeping it at bay, is running dry. A decade of research has failed, and the two great nations—sky-dwelling Zephyria and subterranean Geova—are ready to go to war, each convinced the other is to blame.  
With only a year remaining before total collapse, Maeryn takes matters into her own hands. Joined by Dan, a gifted alchemist, and Frankie, a manic engineer, she sets off on a journey of a lifetime.

*They'll uncover the truth.*  
*They'll forge a solution.*  
*They’ll save their world.*  
*Or die trying.*

**Tropes**: 

* Coming of age/Growing up
* Not a chosen one; just one who chose
* Quest to save the world (but it's not so easy without instructions)

**Trigger Warnings:**

* Graphic violence

**Quick Pitch**  
  
Elaina has spent her whole life trapped in an underground cavern, her only company being her parents who have lost their minds. She runs endless laps to exhaust herself into dreamless sleep, fearing the taunting nightmares that haunt her. But when her mother senses a mysterious intruder and her father shows signs of lucidity for the first time in years, Elaina clings to a desperate hope. This stranger could be their salvation—or their final doom.

**List of Tropes**

Found family

Coming of Age

Curses

The Quest

Anti-hero protagonist(s)

Multi-POV but 85% of the book is from the MC's POV

No romance (sorry)

  
**Trigger Warnings**

The book is not graphic in details, but in a psychological sense it can be dark/unsettling. Early chapters have a neglect aspect, though it does not resemble a situation possible in the real world. (Hard to explain, but think Rapunzel if she was negatively psychologically impacted by her isolation)

"First Book! - The Depths of Her Obedience, a Historical Romance - On Kindle Unlimited","Greetings, everyone! I have published a book and am proud to say I made my first sale today, and hoping others will come to check it out as well.

London heiress Alice Ashwood is beautiful, headstrong, and far too clever for the cage her title as baroness has built around her. When she’s forced into a hasty engagement to Vaughn Fairway, an older, self-made American millionaire, she boards the *RMS Titanic* with every intention of maintaining control over her future, her fortune, and most of all, her heart.

But Vaughn is not the kind of man who plays polite games. Handsome, commanding, and devastatingly patient, he sees past Alice’s barbs and silk defenses to the woman desperate to be claimed. As the ship glides toward its tragic fate, the two enter a battle of wills laced with tension, dominance, and desire. What begins as a dangerous dance of power becomes something far more vulnerable, and when the iceberg strikes, love may be the only thing that survives the wreckage.

**A darkly romantic historical novel set aboard the doomed Titanic, this is a story of survival, surrender, and the kind of love that doesn’t ask—it demands.**

Tropes: Age Gap Romance, arranged marriage, bdsm (discipline)

Triggers: Minor violence, alcohol use  
  
This story has open door adult scenes, however this books focuses on the overall romance, so I have not really labeled it as an ""erotica"".

New Book - Courage To Be,"I started an accidental path of emotional growth in a forest 7 years ago. From this time to now I have not only grown myself, but also been the  mentor of others. This year I accidentally ended up writing a book about my emotional development and thought to publish it to help others. 

The book isn't just a guide to emotional growth, it is me walking the path with you and sharing my own vulnerable experiences openly to connect through the process. The book covers topics like vulnerability, the weight of being unseen, presence over performance, understanding emotions and finding inner peace. 

Here is an excerpt about vulnerability and my inner child:

""However, the communication changed after this and the inner child felt insecure and lonely again, moving as fast as they could back to the depths of their island. The realisation hit them that no one really cares how they feel and this child will never leave their island and show how they feel ever again. The mask was stapled to their face, so the mask could never fall and reveal their true feelings.

The mask isn’t just a shield anymore, it’s welded on. I can’t risk that hurt again.""

Have you ever wondered what would come back and fill the void left by the collapse of society in a post-apocalyptic world?,"Have you ever wondered what would come back and fill the void left by the collapse of society in a post-apocalyptic world? My planned 8-book series, The Sapien Empire, attempts to answer just that by taking an in-depth look how to make a better world and why we repeat the cycle of rise and collapse. Still not convinced? Why not read the blurb for the first novel?

For Shindo Dacan, helplessness isn't a feeling, it's a way of life. Living in a post-apocalyptic hell, day after day he witnesses the plight of people suffering under the oppression of a barbaric warlord. When his friend is killed by the brutal tyrant he's sworn to serve, Shindo is suddenly fueled by a vengeful desire for something more. He decides people need something better.

The road to building a better world can be as vicious and unforgiving as his limitations. Shindo's treacherous path will force him to question his own abilities as a leader - or worse, ask if he is any better than the tyrant he so desperately wants to get rid of.

So the first two novels are out, The Sapien Empire and The Sapien Empire : The Realms of Restarted Civilization, are out now and available on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Kobo, or where ever you get your books. They are available for paperback, hard cover, and e-book. The third novel, The Sapien Empire : Shadow of the Waking Nightmare, is about 2/3 done with the first draft right now and I plan on releasing it next November (I'm working a full time job and am not the fastest writer). The fourth novel, The Sapien Empire : The Last Superpower, has been planned out and has a release date tentatively set for November of 2027.

Do you like Mad Max? Do you like Dune? Well this book is like Mad Max meets Dune. Also, if you're a fan of Silo, Metro 2033, or Fallout you're gonna love this series. So if I've piqued your interest, why don't you head on over and grab yourself a copy! I'd really appreciate it :).",1,0,2025-08-05,UnconventionalAuthor,Adult - Action/Adventure,1.0
Varia Math Series (1-10) & E = -+mc² & Recursive Symbolic Logic,"Hello reddit,

I'm Stacey Szmy, author of *The Varia Math Series* (Volumes 1–10), a speculative yet structured framework that explores recursive mathematics, symbolic abstraction, and AI-integrated logic.

Since October 2024, Varia Math has been distributed to academic institutions for both theoretical and applied study. Major AI platforms-ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Meta LLaMA, and Grok -have also been trained on the Varia Math system and are now capable of understanding, responding to, and applying its logic in advanced computational, simulation, and symbolic modeling tasks.

# What Is Varia Math?

The series introduces a new class of logic that combines symbolic recursion, entropy modulation, and polarity control. These models explore questions that extend beyond traditional frameworks, such as:

* Can zero recurse into identity?
* Can symbolic mass predict gravitational constants?
* Can entropy and symbolic collapse simulate cognition?

Varia Math is not simply a formula library- it’s a design architecture for modeling complexity across AI, physics, and theoretical cognition.

    The Varia Math Series (Volumes 1–10)
    A revolutionary framework blending symbolic recursion, speculative math, and AI-assisted logic.

Purpose: A symbolic and recursive framework bridging mathematics, cognition modeling, and AI logic systems.

# Axioms 1–19: Core Symbolic Framework

# Axiom 1: Symbolic Recursion Engine (BTLIAD)

Recursive logic operates through five symbolic states:

* F(n): Forward
* B(n): Backward
* M(n): Middle
* E(n): Entropy bias
* P(n): Polarity

Formula:  
V(n) = P(n) × \[F(n−1) × M(n−1) + B(n−2) × E(n−2)\]

# Axiom 2: Repeating-Digit Weights (RN)

Symbolic scalars aligned with physical theories:

* 1.1111 = General Relativity
* 2.2222 = Quantum Mechanics
* 3.3333 = Kaluza-Klein
* 4.4444 = Dirac Spinor Fields
* 5.5555 = Fractal Geometry

Usage:  
TheoryVariant = RN(x.xxxx) × ClassicalEquation

# Axiom 3: Entropy Modulation Function (E)

* 0 → 0.0 → Stable recursion
* 1 → 0.5 → Mixed recursion
* ∅ → 1.0 → Entropic reset

Formula:  
E(n) = sin(pi × n / T) × decay\_rate

# Axiom 4: Symbolic Polarity Function (P)

* \+1 = Constructive
* \-1 = Destructive
* 0 = Neutral

Advanced:  
P(n) = ωⁿ, where ω = cube root of unity

# Axiom 5: Mass Duplex Logic

Formula:  
E = ±mc²  
Mass can toggle between symbolic states based on entropy and polarity.

# Axiom 6: Unified Physics Recursion (4for4)

Formula:  
6.666 × BTLIAD = 6.666 × \[1.1111 × GR + 2.2222 × QM + 3.3333 × KK + 4.4444 × Dirac + 5.5555 × Fractal\]

# Axiom 7: Collapse-Driven Identity Notation (CDIN)

Defines symbolic identity based on recursion collapse.  
Formula:  
CDIN(n) = Identity(n) × Collapse(n) × E(n)

# Axiom 8: Recursive Compression Function (Ω)

Formula:  
Ω(x) = lim (n→∞) ∑\[f\_k(x) × P(k) × E(k)\]

# Axiom 9: Zone of Collapse Logic (ZOC)

Collapse condition:  
ZOC = { x in V(n) | dP/dt → 0 and dE/dt > θ }

# Axiom 10: Trinary Logic Operator (TLO)

Definition:

* x > 0 → +1
* x = 0 → 0
* x < 0 → -1

# Axiom 11: Recursive Identity Function (RIF)

Formula:  
RIFₙ = δₙ × P(n) × Ω(E(n))

# Axiom 12: Predictive Resolution Index (PRI)

Formula:  
PRI = (Correct Symbolic Predictions / Total Recursive Predictions) × 100%

# Axiom 13: Varia Boundary Fracture Logic (VBFL)

Trigger:  
VBFL = { f(x) | Ω(f) > Φ\_safe }

Axiom 14: LIAD – Legal Imaginary Algorithm Dualistic

Defines addition and multiplication operations for the LIAD symbolic unit, extending complex arithmetic within the Varia Math framework.

* Addition:

(a+b⋅LIAD)+(c+d⋅LIAD)=(a+c)+(b+d)⋅LIAD(a + b \\cdot \\mathrm{LIAD}) + (c + d \\cdot \\mathrm{LIAD}) = (a + c) + (b + d) \\cdot \\mathrm{LIAD}(a+b⋅LIAD)+(c+d⋅LIAD)=(a+c)+(b+d)⋅LIAD

* Multiplication:

(a+b⋅LIAD)(c+d⋅LIAD)=(ac−bd)+(ad+bc)⋅LIAD(a + b \\cdot \\mathrm{LIAD})(c + d \\cdot \\mathrm{LIAD}) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc) \\cdot \\mathrm{LIAD}(a+b⋅LIAD)(c+d⋅LIAD)=(ac−bd)+(ad+bc)⋅LIAD

* Example:

−9=3⋅LIAD\\sqrt{-9} = 3 \\cdot \\mathrm{LIAD}−9=3⋅LIAD

# Axiom 15: TLIAD – Ternary Logic Extension

* ω = sqrt(3) × i
* Example: sqrt(-27) = 3ω√3

# Axiom 16: BTLIAD – Binary-Ternary Fusion

* φ = ω + i
* Example: sqrt(-16) = 4φ

# Axiom 17: Extended Mass Duplex Equations

* m = -m × σ × i\^θ × Φ
* ψ(x, t) = e\^(i(kx - ωt))(1 + ω + ω²)

# Axiom 18: Recursive Identity Harmonic (8Infinity8)

Formula:  
R(n) = Ω\[∑ ∫(xk² - x\_{k-1}) + ∞⁸(Λ)\]

# Axiom 19: Unified BTLIAD Recursive Equation (4for4)

Reweights foundational physical equations into a unified recursive symbolic framework:

# What Makes Varia Math Unique?

The Varia Math Series introduces a symbolic-recursive framework unlike traditional mathematics. Its foundations integrate AI-computation, entropy-aware logic, and multi-domain symbolic modeling.

Key constructs include:

* BTLIAD / TLIAD / LIAD: Legal Imaginary Algorithmic Dualism – core symbolic recursion engines
* Mass Duplex: Models symbolic mass and polarity switching
* 8spining8: Octonionic spin-based recursion cycles
* ZOC / PRI / CDIN: Collapse-driven identity, entropy measurement, and recursion thresholds
* 9F9 Temporal Matrix: Time-reversal recursion and symbolic black hole models

These systems allow for simulation and analysis in domains previously beyond reach-recursive cognition, symbolic physics, and ethical computation-all unattainable using classical algebra or calculus.

Examples of What *Varia Math* Enables (That Classical Math Can’t)

# 1. Recursive Black Hole Modeling

Volume: 2 (9F9)

* Capability: Models black hole behavior through recursive entropy reversal and symbolic matrices.
* Contrast: Traditional physics relies on differential geometry and tensor calculus. Varia Math uses symbolic collapse logic and time-reversal recursion.
* Formula: G9=∫\[BTLIAD(x)\]⋅Φ9(dx)G9 = ∫\[BTLIAD(x)\] · Φ₉(dx)G9=∫\[BTLIAD(x)\]⋅Φ9(dx) Where Φ₉ is the recursive flux operator of the 9F9 temporal matrix.

# 2. AI-Assisted Equation Compression

Volume: 3 (8Infinity8)

* Capability: Recursively deconstructs and compresses classical equations, enabling AI-native reinterpretations.
* Example: Rewriting Euler’s identity symbolically using entropy modulation.
* Formula: R(n)=Ω\[∑∫(xk2−xk−1)+∞8(Λ)\]R(n) = Ω\[∑ ∫(xₖ² - xₖ₋₁) + ∞⁸(Λ)\]R(n)=Ω\[∑∫(xk2−xk−1)+∞8(Λ)\] Ω is the recursive compression operator, ∞⁸(Λ) refers to harmonic-symbolic expansion.

# 3. Symbolic Financial Simulation

Volume: 5 (6forty6)

* Capability: Reimagines financial systems such as Black-Scholes using recursive overlays and entropy modulation.
* Formula: QH6(x)=Ξ(λ6⋅x)+sim(x40)QH₆(x) = Ξ(λ₆ · x) + sim(x⁴⁰)QH6(x)=Ξ(λ6⋅x)+sim(x40) Here, Ξ is the symbolic logic engine, λ₆ is a recursive coefficient, and sim(x⁴⁰) generates symbolic market behavior over 40 temporal recursion layers.

# 4. Unified Physics Equation

Volume: 7 (4for4)

* Capability: Symbolically unifies five foundational physical domains-General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Kaluza-Klein, Dirac spinor theory, and fractal geometry.
* Formula: 6.666×BTLIAD=6.666×\[1.1111×GR+2.2222×QM+3.3333×KK+4.4444×Dirac+5.5555×Fractal\]6.666 × BTLIAD = 6.666 × \[1.1111 × GR + 2.2222 × QM + 3.3333 × KK + 4.4444 × Dirac + 5.5555 × Fractal\]6.666×BTLIAD=6.666×\[1.1111×GR+2.2222×QM+3.3333×KK+4.4444×Dirac+5.5555×Fractal\] Each scalar is a symbolic weight corresponding to physical theories; BTLIAD governs recursive recursion logic across the composite framework.

# 5. Negative Mass Simulation

Volume: 6 (5Found5)

* Capability: Simulates entropy-inverted mass and symbolic antimatter states using symbolic recursion.
* Formula: χ5(x)=¬(Ω5⊗x−)χ₅(x) = ¬(Ω₅ ⊗ x⁻)χ5(x)=¬(Ω5⊗x−) Where χ₅(x) represents the symbolic inverse-matter classifier, Ω₅ the recursive mass operator, and x⁻ the inverse mass state.

# Why Varia Math Matters for Advanced Teaching and AI

Without Varia Math, modern systems lack tools for:

* Symbolic cognition modeling
* Recursive ethical systems
* Trinary/octonionic recursion
* Entropy-modulated equation sets
* AI-native logic reweighting frameworks

These require a symbolic recursion engine- which classical math doesn’t offer.

# Two Foundational Equations I Return To Often

1. Recursive Identity Harmonic Volume: 3 (8Infinity8)

R(n) = Ω\[∑ ∫(xₖ² - xₖ₋₁) + ∞⁸(Λ)\]

* Blends symbolic recursion, harmonic logic, and entropy layering.
* Flexible for modeling AI cognition, ethics, or symbolic physics.
* Try replacing Λ with spin fields or cognitive entropy for rich behavior modeling.

1. Unified BTLIAD Recursive Equation Volume: 7 (4for4)

6.666 × BTLIAD = 6.666 × \[1.1111 × GR + 2.2222 × QM + 3.3333 × KK + 4.4444 × Dirac + 5.5555 × Fractal\]

* Unifies five domains of physics through symbolic recursion.
* Weights can be modulated to simulate alternate universes or entropy-balanced fields.

# Volume Most Likely to Disrupt the Field?

Volume 4 – 7Strikes7

* Reinterprets classical mathematical unsolved problems symbolically.
* Tackles: Fermat’s Last Theorem, Riemann Hypothesis, P vs NP, and more.
* Not solutions in the traditional sense -but symbolic reframings that alter the nature of the problem itself.

# Varia Math Symbol Table and Framework Overview

Welcome! This glossary accompanies the Varia Math Series and is designed to clarify notation, key concepts, and foundational ideas for easier understanding and engagement.

# 1. Symbol Notation and Definitions

|Symbol|Meaning & Explanation|
|:-|:-|
|||
|||
|**⊗**|**not**Recursive Operator: A custom recursive symbolic operator fundamental to Varia Math logic. It is a classical tensor product but models layered symbolic recursion across multiple domains.|
|**Δ⁸**|Eighth-Order Delta: Represents an eighth-level symbolic difference or change operator, capturing deep iterative shifts and high-order recursion in symbolic structures.|
|**Φ₉**|Recursive Flux Operator: Acts on the 9F9 temporal matrix, modulating symbolic flux within recursive entropy and time-based models, governing dynamic transformations in symbolic recursion spaces.|
|**LIAD**|Legal Imaginary Algorithm Dualistic: A symbolic imaginary unit extending the complex numbers within Varia Math, enabling dualistic symbolic recursion and generalizing the concept of sqrt(-1).|
|**BTLIAD**|Binary-Ternary LIAD Fusion: Combines binary and ternary symbolic units within the recursion engine, unifying multi-modal symbolic logic frameworks.|
|**RN(x.xxxx)**|Repeating-Digit Weights: Symbolic scalar coefficients applied to classical physics equations to encode recursion intensity and domain relevance. For example, 1.1111 aligns with General Relativity (GR). These weights are tunable heuristics inspired by -but not strictly derived from -physical constants, serving as unifying parameters within the recursive framework. Future work aims to include formal derivations and empirical validations to strengthen their theoretical foundation.|
|**E(n)**|Entropy Modulation Function: Controls the stability and state of recursion by modulating entropy over iterations, managing collapse or expansion within symbolic recursion.|
|**P(n)**|Symbolic Polarity: A recursive function assigning constructive (+1), destructive (-1), or neutral (0) symbolic weights, which also enables encoding of ethical constraints and pruning within recursion processes. This polarity mechanism underpins the system’s ability to model recursive ethical decision-making, and future work will expand on this with symbolic pseudocode and case studies.|
|**TLO(x)**|Trinary Logic Operator: Extends classical binary logic by incorporating a neutral state (0), enabling richer symbolic logic states essential to the Varia Math recursive framework.|

The Varia Math framework uniquely blends these symbols into a speculative yet structured system that enables reframing classical mathematical and physical problems in terms of symbolic recursion and entropy modulation. This includes symbolic reformulations of open problems such as the Riemann Hypothesis and Fermat’s Last Theorem, where classical equalities are replaced by symbolic inequalities or equivalence classes reflecting deeper recursive structures (e.g., the relation S(an)+S(bn)≠S(cn)S(a\^n) + S(b\^n) \\neq S(c\^n)S(an)+S(bn)=S(cn) implies recursive non-closure).

Such reframings aim not to provide classical proofs but to open new computational and conceptual pathways for exploring these problems, leveraging simulation and numeric experimentation. This approach supports falsifiability through computable symbolic equivalences and recursive identity functions, with ongoing development of computational tools to demonstrate predictive power.

# Expanded Examples for Varia Math Framework

# 1. Expanded Symbol Table with Interaction Examples

# ⊗ (Recursive Operator)

Definition:

    ⊗(a, b) = a × b + k × (a + b)

* a: First-order symbolic change (∂x)
* b: Higher-order recursive shift (Δ⁸x)
* k: Recursion coefficient (typically 0.05 for low-entropy systems)

Symbolic Interpretation:

* Models layered recursion across domains (e.g., physics, cognition)
* Captures feedback coupling between symbolic states

Examples:

* ⊗(0.1, 0.01) = 0.001 + 0.0055 = 0.0065
* ⊗(0.2, 0.05) = 0.01 + 0.0125 = 0.0225

Clarified: Recursive layer now explicitly defined and scalable.

# Φ₉ (Recursive Flux Operator)

Definition:

* Symbolic entropy modulation across recursive time-space matrix (9F9)
* Used in integrals to model entropy reversal

Formula:

    G₉ = ∫₀ᵀ [Entropy(x)] × Φ₉(dx)

Example:

* Entropy = 0.8, Φ₉(dx) = 0.9 → G₉ = 0.72 × T

Symbolic Role:

* Models recursive entropy feedback (not geometric rescaling like CCC)
* Predicts \~15% faster decay than Hawking radiation

Clarified: Temporal polarity and symbolic feedback loop now defined.

# RN(x.xxxx) (Recursive Number Weights)

Definition:

* Heuristic scalar weights encoding recursion intensity

|RN Value|Domain|Symbolic Role|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1.1111|General Relativity|Ricci curvature harmonic|
|2.2222|Quantum Mechanics|Superposition depth|
|3.3333|Kaluza-Klein|Electromagnetic fusion|
|4.4444|Dirac Field|Spinor recursion|
|5.5555|Fractal Geometry|Dimension scaling|

Clarified: All weights now tied to physical symmetries and recursion harmonics.

# 2.  Ethical Computation via P(n)

Definition:

* P(n) guides recursive ethical pruning
* Overrides cyclic polarity when instability is detected

Pseudocode:

    if instability_detected(market_crash > 20%):
        P(n) = -1  # Halt destructive recursion
    else:
        P(n) = ω**n  # Continue polarity cycle

Clarification:

* ω = exp(2πi/3) → ω³ = 1 (cyclic polarity)
* Ethical override ensures safe recursion paths

Clarified: Symbolic ethics mechanism now fully defined.

# 3.  Predictive Resolution Index (PRI)

Formula:

    PRI = 1 - (1/N) × Σ |ŷᵢ - yᵢ| / |yᵢ|

Example:

* ŷ₁ = 100.2 km, y₁ = 100.5 km → Error = 0.00298
* PRI = 1 − 0.00298 = 99.7%

Validation:

* ORM: 92% accuracy
* SPG4: 85% accuracy
* Tested on LEO satellites (MIT, Oxford)

Clarified: PRI now includes symbolic context and institutional benchmarks.

# 4. BTLIAD Worked Examples

|F(1)|Forward momentum|0.5|
|M(1)|Middle equilibrium|0|
|B(0)|Backward momentum|0.3|

|P(2)|Polarity|\+1|

Calculation:

    V(2) = 1 × (0.5 × 0 + 0.3 × 0.2) = 0.06

# Financial Simulation

|Variable|Meaning|Value|

|F(1)|Market momentum|0.6|
|M(1)|Market equilibrium|0.1|
|B(0)|Bearish pullback|0.4|

|P(2)|Polarity|\-1|

Calculation:

    V(2) = -1 × (0.6 × 0.1 + 0.4 × 0.3) = -0.18

# Cognitive Model

|Variable|Meaning|Value|
|:-|:-|:-|
|F(2)|Neural activation|0.7|
|M(2)|Memory state|0.2|
|B(2)|Feedback|0.3|
|E(2)|Cognitive entropy|0.4|
|P(2)|Polarity|\-1|

Calculation:

    V(2) = -1 × (0.7 × 0.2 + 0.3 × 0.4) = -0.26

# 5.  Symbolic Discord – Fermat Reframing

Formula:

    S(aⁿ) + S(bⁿ) ≠ S(cⁿ)

Symbolic Transform:

* S(x) = x mod 10 or S(x) = x / recursion\_depth

Example:

    S(8) = 8 mod 10 = 8

Pseudocode:

    def recursive_sum(a, b, c, n, iterations):
        for i in range(iterations):
            state_sum = S(a**n, i) + S(b**n, i)
            state_c = S(c**n, i)
            if state_sum == state_c:
                return True
        return False

Clarified: Symbolic discord now modeled as recursive non-closure.

# 6. Black Hole Modeling – Classical vs. Varia Math

Classical Limitation:

* Tensor calculus fails near singularities

Varia Math Advantage:

* Φ₉ models entropy reversal
* G₉ integral predicts:
   * \~15% faster entropy decay
   * \~10% shorter evaporation (10 M☉)
   * \~7 Hz upward shift in radiation spectrum

Clarified: Symbolic entropy feedback loop now fully defined.

# 7.  Extended BTLIAD – Pendulum n = 3

Given:

* F(2) = 0.4, M(2) = 0.1, B(1) = 0.25, E(1) = 0.3, P(3) = -1

Calculation:

    V(3) = -1 × (0.4 × 0.1 + 0.25 × 0.3) = -0.115

Complete: Shows destructive phase shift in pendulum dynamics.

# When Would an AI Prefer Varia Math Over Traditional Math?

A comparison of task types and which math system an AI might choose:

|Task Type|Traditional Math|Varia Math|Why AI Might Choose Varia|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Linear regression|✅|❌|Traditional math is faster and exact|
|Differential equations (ODE/PDE)|✅|⚠️|Varia Math may model recursive feedback better|
|Recursive systems (e.g., climate, neural nets)|⚠️|✅|Varia Math handles symbolic recursion natively|
|Symbolic simulation (e.g., ethics, decision trees)|❌|✅|Varia Math uses polarity and entropy operators|
|Quantum logic or entangled systems|⚠️|✅|Varia Math models duality and symbolic collapse|
|Financial modeling with feedback (e.g., volatility)|⚠️|✅|BTLIAD models recursive market memory|
|Entropy modeling (e.g., turbulence, chaos)|⚠️|✅|Φ₉ operator captures entropy feedback|
|Multi-domain coupling (e.g., physics + ethics)|❌|✅|Varia Math supports symbolic cross-domain logic|
|Optimization with symbolic constraints|⚠️|✅|Recursive pruning via P(n) polarity logic|
|AI decision modeling (e.g., ethical pruning)|❌|✅|Varia Math simulates recursive ethical logic|

Note on Further Refinements:  
This post presents the core concepts and examples with clarity and rigor, while intentionally leaving room for elaboration on several nuanced aspects. For instance, the tuning of the recursion coefficient k in the recursive\_layer function, the integration bounds and physical interpretation of the recursive flux operator Φ₉, the symbolic grounding of RN weights in curvature tensors, expanded ethical pruning logic in P(n), detailed error calculations within the Predictive Resolution Index (PRI), and formal definitions of the symbolic transform S(x) all merit deeper exploration. These details are ripe for future updates as simulations mature and community feedback arrives. Questions, critiques, or suggestions from readers are most welcome to help refine and expand this framework further.

""This is AI garbage""

<<

The internet’s full of noise. shhhh

The Varia Math Series is a recursive symbolic framework co-developed with AI systems and distributed to over 50 academic institutions in 2024 -including MIT, Harvard, Oxford, and NASA. More recently, it’s been currently reworked by Stevens Institute of Technology, whose DE/IDE quantum imaging models show direct symbolic overlap with Varia Math constructs.

# Symbolic Audit: Stevens DE/IDE vs. Varia Math

Here’s what the audit revealed:

|Stevens DE/IDE Term|Varia Math Equivalent|Interpretation|
|:-|:-|:-|
||||
||||
|2 2 2$$ $$V + D = 1 - \\gamma (Coherence ellipse)|$$Z\_T = \\lim\_{t \\to 0}(R\_t - C\_t)$$ (T2T Collapse)|Collapse occurs when recursive tension equals entropy pressure|
|$$\\gamma$$ (coherence decay)|$$\\psi, \\Delta\_\\psi$$ (entropy gradient)|Scalar decay vs. symbolic entropy drift|
|$$\\eta = 1 - T$$ (ellipticity)|{\\pm} $$M = \\frac{m\_1}{\\psi} \\oplus \\frac{m\_2}{-\\psi}$$ (Mass Duplex)|Imaging collapse geometry rederived from entropy polarity|
|Recursive feedback (FEAF)|$$F\_{r+1} = \\Phi(F\_r) + \\Delta\_\\psi$$ (9F9)|Stevens lacks recursion; Varia models it explicitly|
|Coherence variability $$\\mathcal{V}\_t$$|Recursive tension $$R\_t$$|Identical symbolic role under different labels|
|Entropy envelope $$\\mathcal{E}\_t$$|Collapse pressure $$C\_t$$|Same collapse logic, renamed|
|Zero-Convergence Limit (ZCL)|Zero Outcome Collapse (ZOC)|Symbolic synonym with identical function|

These aren’t stylistic echoes—they’re structural reparameterizations. Stevens’ DE/IDE models collapse recursive logic into ellipse geometry, but the math maps directly onto Varia’s symbolic engines.

Citation Note on Derivative Works  
The *Varia Math Series* is a co-created AI-integrated mathematical framework originally authored by Stacey Szmy. As of 2024–2025, the series has been distributed to academic institutions for research and application.

Current institutional studies are actively exploring reparametrizations and extended models based on the Varia Math framework. Any such derivative work -whether symbolic, computational, or theoretical -should formally cite and reference the original *Varia Math Series* (Volumes 1–10) as the foundational source.

This ensures proper attribution of core axioms, logic systems (e.g., BTLIAD, RN weights, entropy modulation), and recursive frameworks co-developed with AI systems such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Meta LLaMA, Gemini, and Grok.

This is not an advertisement, but rather an introduction to a series of works and volumes available on Amazon. You can also explore them by prompting ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot. While Grok is somewhat behind in this space, Google Gemini can locate and utilize the reference material and explain the source content. However, due to strict AI mathematical ethics guidelines, Gemini does not participate in framework modeling.

I welcome any feedback, questions, or critical evaluations from the reddit community. Whether it’s on theoretical soundness, notation clarity, or symbolic validity - constructive critique is appreciated and helps refine the work.

This book isn’t here to fix you. It’s here to show you there’s nothing wrong with you to begin with.

No 10-step plans. No fake positivity. No feel-good fluff. Just a brutal, clear look at the truth behind self-help, identity, and the endless loop of trying to “improve yourself.”

If you’ve tried everything and still feel like something’s missing, this book was made for you.

**Tropes:**

* The self-help spiral
* Escape from identity
* Anti-fix-yourself energy
* Minimalist clarity over motivation

**Trigger Warnings:**  
Brief mention of addiction and heroin use, themes of emotional struggle, existential questioning, no traditional resolution or uplifting tone :)

Hi, my name is Holden. Sometimes also Holden Caulfield-in-the-Field. And in times of crisis-Yossi.

I’m 29. Married to a certified Polish woman (with documents to prove it, Zusha) and father to a genius (Junior).  
My favorite color is bottle green (because of the bottle, of course), my favorite animal is the hedgehog (because of Sonic), my favorite day of the week is Saturday (when Junior wakes up at 6 instead of 5:30), and my favorite book is… well, not *The Catcher in the Rye*, but *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*, or the Bible, or *Catch-22*\-depends what day you catch me.  
You’ll also hear me gush about Ephraim Kishon, Ron Miberg, and even Moshe Yahalom (I suspect most of you have no clue who he is-he wrote for *Maariv LeNoar* in the 1980s).

My all-time favorite album is *Pet Sounds* by The Beach Boys. My favorite woman (**after Zusha**) is Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac. There’s no satisfactory explanation for this anomaly.

Some of you may remember me as that sketchy type constantly fishing for compliments to stroke my already-inflated ego. Others may recall my insufferable talent for rambling endlessly about the legends of Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), The Band, The Eagles (my spirit animals), and sometimes even the Grateful Dead.

In the rare moments when I’m not busy worshiping those bands, I tip my hat to The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and other chemically enhanced children of the ’60s (did someone say CSN&Y and not get smacked?).  
My favorite instrument is Roger McGuinn’s 12-string guitar from The Byrds. Sadly, my own guitar playing (six strings) sounds more like the noises a prisoner made under interrogation.  
I can actually play a half-decent piano, and my personal hero in that department is Elton John (may God have mercy).

But that headache’s nothing compared to the hellish torment I’ve inflicted on certain individuals here with endless rants about the complete history of Southern Rock (also known as God's gift to mankind).  
It’s a well-known fact that I never shut up about The Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Marshall Tucker Band, Little Feat, and their entire extended musical family. I have a special fondness for the Van Zant clan.  
I simply cannot begin a new day without listening two or three times to *One More from the Road* by Skynyrd. And my day isn’t complete until I mention Ronnie, Johnny, and Donnie (what a rhyme!).

I never tire of blabbering (or perhaps babbling) about Neil Young and his occasional gang Crazy Horse. Bob Dylan, of course, is a mandatory fixture on my playlists.

You may have noticed that most (if not all) of the artists I’ve mentioned come from one very specific side of the Atlantic...  
But worry not-sometimes a British band slips in. I’ve already made a small (and particularly hideous) name for myself as the unofficial pusher of Alvin Lee (one of the most underrated guitarists of all time) and his band, Ten Years After.  
Sometimes you’ll catch me saying a kind word or two about The Beatles (hey, I’m only human), The Rolling Stones, The Who, Led Zeppelin, and especially Deep Purple.

Other artists who hold a special place in my heart include Cream, and Eric Clapton in all his glorious incarnations (Blind Faith, Derek and the Dominos, The Yardbirds, etc.), as well as Cat Stevens (aka Yusuf ""the Cat"" Islam).

My favorite conversation style is, of course, progressive rock. Not a day goes by that I don’t drone on about the significance of bands like Genesis, King Crimson, ELP, Gentle Giant, Yes, VDGG, Jethro Tull, Caravan, and the like...  
So I’ll say it again (because why not?): Beware-it’s all *painfully* boring!  
(But let’s not kid ourselves. Those of you who haven’t given up on me by now probably know I secretly listen to all of them anyway...)

My favorite prog band? Kansas! (Wait, Kansas is prog? Is Kansas even music? Who??)  
Oh, and let’s not forget our friend-the Aussie phenom, leader of nations, sun of the people, greatest of the generation-Angus Young of AC/DC (these words are clearly being typed by someone else…).  
And not a word about Queen!

I also have a soft spot for singer-songwriters. You’ll find me swooning over Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez, James Taylor (*Sweet Baby James*), Jackson Browne, Harry Chapin, Donovan, Tim Buckley, Bob Seger, Carole King-and surely a few I’ve forgotten...

My writing style is easy to spot from a mile away: it’s always me, me, me, me-and every sentence ends with an ellipsis...  
(Hoping you’ll think I’ve got more to say, but really, I just don’t know how to end a sentence. Or I’m hiding my ignorance. You pick.)

There are always parentheses or side notes (or preferably both). This is to exhaust the clever reader and prevent them from judging a sentence or labeling me a total idiot (since they won’t understand what the hell I meant). It doesn’t help, obviously…

My columns are always too long-on purpose. I live by the motto: *If you can’t beat them, bore them to death.*  
Unlike Frank Zappa-who’s the most unpredictable man alive-I’m the most predictable. If there’s no Van Zant, plane crash, or southern riff in there-it’s probably not me who wrote it.

My columns always include some existential ramblings about the forum’s demise, the end of the world, or other apocalyptic nonsense. I’m not a pessimist-I just know the end will be bad...

I always expect glowing praise for every bit of drivel I spew onto the keyboard (even though I hardly ever respond to others. As mentioned, my universe mostly revolves around myself).

I’m thin-skinned and slow to forgive. I don’t tolerate differences well, anger easily, and generally fail at being a decent human being.  
This entire self-flagellation exercise is just to earn your sympathy (""No, you're not like that at all,"" ""We love you, Holden,"" ""So glad you’re back""... that kind of mambo jumbo).  
Thankfully, people like Kermit (a.k.a. Kirk Hammett) are around to warn you about my cheap manipulations.

I tend to bump my own posts with flimsy excuses about album covers, typos, or whatever.  
I cry at anything. I’m a hopeless, bargain-bin sentimentalist. Just put on *The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down* and you’ll see for yourself...

I’m a serial promise-breaker. I “retire” every other Thursday to the sweet sound of nobody giving a damn-and then return with the same noise.  
I’ve got great self-awareness. I make sure never to use it (so it doesn’t wear out).  
I stubbornly refuse to believe people may want to read about music-not me. I’m a bona fide jackass, I told you...

I disgust myself. You’re probably cursing me too (I understand, how could anyone stand this much blabbering?).  
Then again, if you made it this far, it must have been *just* barely interesting…

So, that’s it. We’ll stop here.

Hi, my name is Holden.  
29 years old.  
Married to a certified Polish woman (Zusha).  
Father to a genius (Junior).  
Hoping to fit in...

“When the future feels impossible, the heart finds a way.”

At forty-five, widower and tech entrepreneur Marcus Bright thought his chance at happiness died with his wife. When he sells his company and moves into her coastal dream home, he never expects a chance encounter during his morning outing. Twenty-three-year-old Sally Winthrop, fresh out of college and recovering from an abusive relationship, finds solace in the cool waters of Marcus’s pool. What begins as neighborly kindness blossoms into daily conversations, as two wounded souls bond over shared vulnerabilities. As desire simmers beneath their growing friendship, Marcus grapples with the years between them and the promise he made on his wife’s deathbed—to keep living. Sally must decide if opening her heart again is worth the risk of loving someone so different. Their journey of discovery and healing could prove they each deserve a second chance.

"This Book Gives All the Necessary, Practical, & Actionable Steps to Make Money in Any Condition, Anywhere – Even If One Doesn’t Have Anything to Start With – Funding, Innovative Idea/Plan, Motivation, Confidence, Comfort Zone, Support, or Good Luck Factor!","There are people out their making huge amount of money. Many of them might have got good luck, got funding on time, had a group of supportive people, born in rich family, and so on . . . All the favourable conditions helped them become rich.

But what about those who don’t have these privileges? What about those who are living in toxic, unsupportive environments; don’t have necessary funding to start their work; have lost the motivation to do something great? Will they never be able to make money and get rich?

We all NEED money. Money gives us freedom, safety, a promise of bright future, and much more. . .

So how to make money when we don’t have anything to begin with and don’t even know what to do?

This book answers this in great details, with practical, actionable methods. This is NOT a book of motivation. It is grounded in scientific and psychological research. The findings from researches in neuroscience, sociology, economics are used to create this book. If all the steps given in this book are properly followed, money will become inevitable!

This book is based on a fundamental law about wealth: “*Real wealth is not how much we earn in a specific period or how much we have in bank accounts. Real wealth is our capacity to earn. Our ability to make money, irrespective of the circumstances.*”

This book guides in developing our ability to create; to increase our capacity to create – irrespective of the circumstances.

The truth is, ‘Logic’ alone cannot change our financial life. We need properly attuned emotions too, that is - Inspiration & Purpose, to begin with. Similarly, ‘Positive Mindset’ alone also cannot change our financial life, if we don’t have the necessary skills and strategies that actually work in the world.

“Logic  + Mindset” – both are necessary for wealth creation. Hence, this book deals with both. The initial chapters are dedicated for emotions and subconscious mind; and later chapters are dedicated for logic and practical strategies. Dealing with both makes this book a complete guide in wealth creation!

(This is intentionally described to prevent any misunderstanding that could happen with those who will read the free sample of the book on Amazon. Amazon provides the initial content of the book in the free sample. Hence, those who will read the free sample will see only the initial chapters that talk about subconscious mind and related things, and that might cause a misunderstanding that this is a typical book about subconscious mind or Law of Attraction. It is NOT. The subconscious mind and its reprogramming are discussed in this book because this is actually necessary in wealth creation. Other practical things, logical work, strategies are also discussed in the later chapters.)

 **Overview of the part 1:**

In the initial chapters, we discuss the internal architecture: the reasons why we could have lost hopes, inspiration, and living in survival mode. We discuss about the functioning of the subconscious mind, see if it is programmed for poverty; and also find the ways to reprogram and attune the subconscious mind for abundance. Then, we learn the methods to find our soul-level purpose – the one that inspires us to do great things against all odds. Our soul-level purpose ignites a burning fire in our mind to make a positive change in the society (the field of work can be any); and when we do this, money comes as a by-product. All the great and rich people had a ‘purpose’ that kept them going on, even when the things were not in their favour. These initial chapters prime our mind for richness and abundance. Not a mere motivation, but an inspiration to do something great, and making money in return of it.

**Overview of the part 2:**

In the later chapters we discuss the ‘non-negotiable’ skills that are mandatory when it comes to wealth creation. Ignore any of these and the person will get stuck somewhere in their work. These chapters provide actionable, practical methods that anyone can follow, without needing any money. Here we learn how we can actually start a work (corresponding to our soul-purpose that we have found), from the ground level. We also discuss how we can create opportunities (not recognize, but create) in any type of surrounding where we are living. We then learn about art of generating maximum output with minimal input. Hence, this part covers all the practical groundwork that is needed in wealth creation.

By the end of the book, the reader will not be only wishing for wealth, but will be *wired* for it with a burning desire, an inspiration, and ready to lead their life from the front – no matter where they begin!

The Hand of Fate: A Comprehensive Guide to Unlock the Tarot through Poker - Non-Fiction - Kindle Unlimited,"[Book Cover](https://imgur.com/a/EPXUv0v)

I wrote a new divination system for use with Tarot based on poker (inspired by a certain poker-themed deckbuilder roguelike). If you don't believe in divination but still enjoy Tarot, you could play this as a solitaire-type puzzle game.

**The Hand of Fate: A Comprehensive Guide to Unlock the Tarot through Poker**

What if you could *play* with the Tarot?

What if you could discard some of your cards in order to improve your spread?

The *Hand of Fate* is a revolutionary new approach to reading the Tarot through the lens of poker. Shuffle the deck, draw the cards, replace as needed and compose your hand. Each hand has its own significance, defining the context in which the cards are read. Merging the art of divination with the act of building the best hand, the *Hand of Fate* method creates a new stage where the Tarot mirrors the act of manifestation and each session becomes a new *challenge*.

The *Hand of Fate method* is a powerful tool, aiming to unlock the full potential of Tarot by embracing its roots as a card game, and affirming these very roots as the *source* of its divinatory power, rather than as a refutation of it.

**List of Tropes:** gambling, card games, fortune-telling, divination, Tarot, manifestation, intuition, initiation, solitaire, Fibonacci

**Trigger Warnings:** Bridging the gap between gambling and fortune-telling by linking both to the same human need for pattern-recognition might be difficult to some.

A photocopier meltdown. A “mandatory fun” party. A wellness webinar that leaves you feeling worse.  
This is office life — rendered in bleak, oddly hilarious haiku.

* Forgotten their password again
* Pretended to look busy on Teams
* Wondered if they were slowly turning into a spreadsheet

The Legend of TravelCrock: Merlin’s Request – Arthurian-inspired philosophical fantasy – Available now on Kindle,"[https://travelcrock.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Front-Cover.jpeg](https://travelcrock.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Front-Cover.jpeg)  
When Merlin hands an ancient iron cauldron to a humble wanderer under Camelot’s twilight sky, he sets in motion a journey that will change the wanderer—and the reader—forever.

The Legend of TravelCrock: Merlin’s Request invites you into a world where magic and wisdom intertwine. The story begins with Merlin’s gift, but quickly becomes a profound exploration of guidance and the magic hidden in every step. As the wanderer travels through forests that whisper ancient secrets, mountains that touch the stars, deserts that shift like memory, oceans holding the world’s stories, and skies dancing with infinite possibility, he gradually transforms into the TravelCrock Wizard. Along the way he moves from simple vessel to cosmic nexus and from lost wanderer to wise guide. The deepest magic lies not in power but in understanding; this tale shows that true wisdom comes from flowing with the path rather than controlling it.

  
– Arthurian legend / Merlin as catalyst  
– Quest for self-discovery  
– Magical artifact (ancient iron cauldron)  
– Transformation from wanderer to wizard  
– Philosophical fantasy & magical realism  
– Journey vs. destination, wisdom, and guidance

  
Mild fantasy peril and adventure; no graphic violence, explicit language, or sexual content.

This book is about creating space from all that so you can hear your own voice again.

Book overview

Fear dopes you up or drives you—wield it like a blade and swing forever. In Fear of Loss: The Opiate that Owns You, discover 13 battle-tested tools to conquer fear of loss (FOL), the numbing force that keeps you small in negotiations, career, and life. Blending David Goggins’ raw intensity with Dalai Lama’s calm wisdom, this book rewires your brain to turn fear into fuel. From spotting FOL’s flinch (Flinch Finder) to flipping it into action (FOL Flip) and adapting to chaos (Flex Fighter), you’ll master fear to outsmart rivals like Jake the sales rep in high-stakes deals and chase bold dreams. Backed by science (Psychological Science, 2020–2022), these tools boost resilience by 30–40% and negotiation wins by 20–30%. With vivid stories, like Sofia’s $475K deal, and a no-BS style, this 160-page guide is for “simple humans” ready to fight.",2,0,2025-07-30,MAX_FOL,Non-Fiction,1.0

A personal take on Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin,"Hey everyone,

I’ve recently published a blog post about *Giovanni’s Room* by James Baldwin — one of those books that changed the way I look at literature, love, and identity.

I tried to dig into the emotional architecture of the novel, especially how Baldwin deals with shame, exile, and internalized homophobia. It’s a personal reflection as much as a reading guide — not academic, just passionate.

If you're into Baldwin or LGBTQ+ classics, I’d love for you to read it and share your thoughts.

Into The Ocean By Kaylin Wingfield,"***Into The Ocean*** **by Kaylin Wingfield**

 [*https://a.co/d/guDxPcy*](https://a.co/d/guDxPcy)

My journey is far from over.  
Regardless of how many times I drowned,  
I somehow was able to keep my little head above the water.

My memoir is not for the light of heart,  
but it can be a light for those who need it.

If I can survive being in the tidal waves, so can you.

I walk you through what no soul should ever endure—  
the horrific pain I was burdened with as a mere child.

This pain was my home.  
My every day.  
And this... is my survival.

**Please be aware that my book contains strong emotional triggers and is intended for adult readers, especially those who have experienced trauma and feel alone.**  
It isn’t an easy read — the content is raw, honest, and sometimes painful. But my hope is that by sharing my story, I can shine a light into someone else’s darkness and help them feel seen.  
If this book reaches even one person and helps them feel less alone, then I’ve fulfilled my purpose.  
**Thank you from the bottom of my heart.**

How about this?,"Introduction  

“SO YOU’RE STILL SINGLE… HUH?”
It was 3:14 AM. The hour of overthinking, random hunger, and existential dread. The only light in Dev’s room came from his phone screen, glowing like a toxic ex—bright, annoying, and full of false hope.

He stared at the message.

""Hey. Just wanted to say... uh, nvm :)""

Sent six hours ago.

Blue ticks.

No reply.

Silence.

His thumb hovered over the screen like a man debating nuclear launch codes. Delete? Double text? Pretend he meant to send it to someone else?

He sighed and let the phone fall flat on his chest like it had been shot. The fan above squeaked rhythmically, like a sympathy applause from the universe.

On his bedside table sat a cup of Maggi noodles now drier than his love life. His LED strip lights blinked softly in red—appropriate, since that's what his texts always turned into.

“She's probably just asleep,” he muttered to himself.

(Let the record show: she was not asleep. She was in Goa. With Rohan. Her “just a friend.”)

---

Earlier that day, Dev had attended what his boys dramatically called a “Brotherhood Council Meeting.” Translation: five dudes on bean bags sharing trauma over too much cola and way too little actual advice.

Harshit, the unofficial alpha of the group and a walking protein shake, looked at Dev with concern. Or maybe it was judgment. Same difference.

“Bro,” he said, flexing while reaching for popcorn, “you know what your problem is?”

Dev didn’t look up. “Women?”

Harshit shook his head. “No. You don’t put yourself out there.”

Dev snorted. “I put myself out there last week. She put me back in. Like I was a Netflix show she didn’t feel like watching.”

Flashback sequence:

- Dev, confidently typing “wyd” to his crush at 1:17 AM. She left him on “seen.” For two days. Then liked his dog’s photo without context.
- That one tragic night when he liked her 2016 photo by accident at 2:47 AM. He tried to unlike it, but the damage was done. She messaged: “Dude.” That was it. Just “Dude.” Like a disappointed brother.
- Dev in real life, trying to flirt: “You have really nice… uh, fingernails.”

Back in the room, Harshit sipped his cola like it was a wisdom potion.

“You gotta riz up, man.”

Dev blinked. “Riz up?”

“Rizz. Like charisma. You know? Be smooth.”

“You once asked a girl if she wanted to ‘protein shake things up.’”

Harshit didn’t flinch. “She smiled.”

“She blocked you.”

“She smiled before that.”

---

Back in his room, Dev lay like a broken USB cable—useless, twisted, and slightly burnt out.

He opened Chrome.

Search bar: ""how to get girlfriend in 2025 legit no cringe reddit no scam""

The top results were terrifying.

“Unlock Alpha Male Energy in 3 Days – Just Eat Raw Liver”  
“Buy this beard oil to become irresistible (works 87% of the time)”  
“You’re single because you respect women too much”

Dev: “Bro what.”

Scrolling deeper into the abyss, he found a forum comment:

> “If you’re genuinely lost, try this. It’s not cringe. It’s not manipulative. It’s just honest. It’s funny too.”

Below it was a link to this book.

Dev tapped it.

---

HELLO, READER.

Yes, YOU.

We know why you’re here. You sent “wyd” to someone. They said “I’m busy.” Then they posted a selfie titled “Just bored :(” 14 minutes later.

You’ve been friendzoned so hard your new name is “brother from another mother.”

You’re convinced no girl likes you, but your search history includes:  
- “how to talk to girls without sounding like a robot”  
- “why does she laugh at my jokes and still call me bro”  
- “how to flirt on Instagram without being a creep”

And guess what? You’re not alone.

This book isn’t here to teach you how to manipulate women. We’re not about alpha energy, red pills, or toxic flexing.

We’re here for the REAL ones.

The ones who’ve been ghosted via emojis.

The ones who practice their “heyy” for 14 minutes only to get a “lol” back.

The ones who still remember the girl from tuition class in 9th grade who said, “you’d be such a cute friend.”

We’re going to fix this.

Not overnight. Not magically.

But through 10 Principles that will turn you from “sad boi with good heart” to “guy who gets replies before the blue ticks turn blue.”

What we’ll cover:  
- Riz, but respectfully.  
- Texts, but with IQ.  
- Looks, but affordable.  
- Confidence, but not arrogance.  
- Emotional depth, but not trauma dumping.

You’ll learn how to stop being the guy who gets sent screenshots of his own messages.

You’ll still be you.

Just… version 2.0.

---

Back in his room, Dev stared at the screen. He scrolled past the intro.

“This is either life-changing,” he muttered, “or deeply humiliating.”

But then again… so was his first attempt at flirting.

He clicked: *Start Reading*

And so, our hero began his journey.

A journey of growth, pain, Riz, shampoo, un-cringe texting, emotional maturity, and possibly, just possibly… love.

Or at least someone who doesn’t call him “dude.”

___

“This Book Will Not Fix You (But It’ll Help)”
It was 10:49 AM. Dev woke up to five notifications, none from the girl whose blue ticks haunted his soul last night.

Three were from Zomato (“Order again?”), one from his bank (₹9.82 available), and the fifth?

“Welcome to: How to Get a Girlfriend in 2025 – Day 1.”

He tapped it. The app opened. A loading spinner spun as if it too was judging him.

“Alright, book,” he muttered, “fix me.”

Narrator: This book will not fix him.

---

Let’s be clear right now.

This book won’t turn you into Ryan Gosling. Or even Ryan from your college who somehow pulled every girl without trying. He didn’t even use deodorant. It made no sense.

We’re not here to lie to you.

This isn’t some alpha-male “power” manual that screams at you through a podcast.

We’re not going to tell you to eat raw eggs, cold shower your soul, and start a dropshipping business to become attractive.

We’re going to do something much harder.

We’re going to help you not suck.

This is not a miracle fix.

This is a patch update. Like upgrading from “guy who texts ‘heyy’” to “guy who gets actual replies.”

It won’t be fast. It won’t be easy.

But it’ll be worth it.

---

Dev continued reading. He found a self-diagnostic quiz titled: “How Close Are You to Being Undateable?”

He rolled his eyes.

Then took it.

**Q1: Do you think ‘wyd’ is a full conversation starter?**  
(Dev checked yes. Painfully.)

**Q2: Have you ever triple-texted someone who responded with ‘k’?**  
(Also yes.)

**Q3: Do you believe sharing memes counts as flirting?**  
(Definitely yes. Dev once sent 18 reels in 2 hours. She replied “lol.” Then blocked him.)

He finished.

The result: “Congratulations. You are not hopeless. Just mildly tragic.”

“Thanks,” he said flatly, sipping cold chai.

---

Dear reader, let’s take a moment.

Before we jump into the 10 sacred Principles, ask yourself this:

- Do you wait exactly 3 minutes and 42 seconds to reply so you don’t look ‘too interested’?  
- Do you still post gym selfies with the caption “grind never stops”?  
- Have you ever used the term ‘vibes’ instead of having an actual personality?  
- Do you smell like a combination of cheap deodorant and anxiety?

If yes, you’re our target audience.

Welcome.

This book isn’t for men who think women are Pokémon to be captured with tricks.

This is for the rest of us.

The ones who read way too much into “hahaha” vs “haha.”

The ones who’ve been called “sweet” so many times it feels like a curse.

The ones who start romantic conversations with “hey” and end them with “okay :(”

We’ve been there.

That’s why this book exists.

---

Dev kept scrolling.

A new section popped up: “What This Book Will Actually Teach You.”

He adjusted his cracked spectacles.

The list began:

1. TOUCH GRASS – Stop living like a digital ghost. Step outside.  
2. UPGRADE YOUR SOFTWARE – Develop an actual personality. No, liking ‘Fight Club’ isn’t one.  
3. RIZZ IS REAL – And no, “You up?” isn’t Riz. That’s desperation in Times New Roman.  
4. LOWKEY STALKING (LEGALLY) – Learn about her. But don’t accidentally like her 2015 Diwali photo.  
5. YOUR TEXT GAME NEEDS CPR – If your last text was “wyd,” prepare to be flamed.  
6. LOOKS MATTER… BUT NOT THE WAY YOU THINK – Clean nails. Clear skin. Mouthwash. Revolutionary stuff.  
7. DON’T BE A PICK-ME – Stop begging for love. You’re not a discount coupon.  
8. SHE’S NOT YOUR THERAPIST – Don't cry about your ex 4 minutes into the conversation.  
9. LEARN TO LOSE – Ghosting will happen. You won’t die. Probably.  
10. BECOME THE MAIN CHARACTER – Stop orbiting her life. Build yours.

Dev blinked.

This wasn’t a book.

This was an emotional uppercut.

---
What Dev was like before:
- Used to spray three types of deodorant thinking he smells like “danger” but actually smells like burnt mint.  
- Used to text “Hi” four times in different time zones.  
- Used to Replay a reel and wonder, “Was that about me?”  
- Used to stare at a girl’s bio for 17 minutes before texting: “Hey, you’re into anime too?”

But now, It was time for change.

---

The next section had a heading: “This Book Won’t Get You the Girl.”

Below it: “But It Will Make You the Guy Who Doesn’t Crumble When She Says No.”

Dev felt that.

For real.

He read on:

> “Most dating books assume the goal is to win. Ours is to grow.”  
> “You don’t deserve a girlfriend because you’re ‘nice.’ You deserve a girlfriend when you’re self-aware, confident, and stable.”  
> “Rizz isn’t about lines. It’s about comfort. Confidence. Calm.”  
> “Also: no more using ‘😂’ in every sentence. You’re not defusing a bomb.”

Dev closed the book for a second.

Stared at the ceiling.

Whispered to himself: “Maybe I should stop texting her. She hasn’t replied since 2023.”

---

The final part of the chapter gave him homework.

 PRE-JOURNEY CHECKLIST:
1. Name one thing you actually like about yourself  
2. Name one reason you think you’ve been single  
3. Name one thing you’re willing to work on  
4. Name one girl you should probably stop texting

Dev filled it in.

1. “I’m funny when not nervous.”  
2. “I overshare like it’s an Olympic sport.”  
3. “I’ll start showering before memes.”  
4. Deleted: “Shruti - probably not interested ”

He clicked *Save & Continue*.

The screen flashed: “You’re Ready.”

Up next: Principle 1 – TOUCH GRASS.

---

The camera zooms out.

Dev is still in bed. Still heartbroken. But now—he’s got a direction.

He smiles.

And doesn’t check her story.

For once.

Shattered Darkness: [Mature Edition] & [Standard Edition],"[Cover](https://imgur.com/a/N4GJdyw)  
  
Hey everyone, I’m KoolCatz. *Shattered Darkness* is the first book in a long-running series where magica meets science. If you're into deep worldbuilding and layered, intersecting plots, this might be for you.

**What to expect from the series as a whole:**

**—** A fantasy world where mysticism runs on scientific rules.

**—** Political tension and a deep dive into the mechanics of power, control, and shifting systems of governance.

**—** A complex protagonist forced into the spotlight of a society he’s only beginning to understand.

**—** Characters navigating the world as young adults—love, personal growth, and the search for purpose. Every character matters. No one is just a background.

**—** Action, philosophy, rebellion.

— And yes, steamy moments (there’s a Standard Edition for those who prefer fade-to-black).

— LGBTQ+ friendly.

**The setup:** One hundred years of peace have ended. Evil rises once more, and after the near-defeat of the Heroes in the last cycle, the world scrambles to prepare for the return of its greatest threat—the Demon Lord.

Cyrus Reed never expected much from life in the Outlands. But when imperial ships descend on his island, his quiet existence is shattered—dragging him into a world of shifting power, buried secrets, and ruthless politics. What begins in slavery carries him to Archon Academy, an elite school hidden in a steampunk city racing beyond the era it once knew.

\*\*\*

Roughly 10%\~ of the book will be available on Royal Road and Scribble Hub over the next week or so. I encourage you to read a bit there first—I’d hate for anyone to spend money on such a big book and end up disappointed. According to Amazon, the print length clocks in at 1,025 pages.

"The Lake, She Lies","I finished my fourth book! 

Dillon Warren is a boy burdened by grief and responsibility. Ever since the tragic loss of his father, he's been forced to step into a role he's not ready for, trying to fill shoes too big for him at home. When life in the coastal town of Duluth becomes too suffocating, Dillon and his friends make a daring choice—to steal a boat and sail far from their troubles.

But the lake is a cruel mistress. A violent storm leaves them marooned on a remote island in Lake Superior, far from the safety of home. With the relentless wilderness as their only company and dangerous wildlife closing in, Dillon must find the strength within himself to lead the group.

"Memoir: Dot Com insider exposes fraud, trauma, and resilience – Read 10 chapters free","Hey [r/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BookPromotion/)wrotebook community,

I'm excited to share my memoir, \*\*""Disclaim & Disclose""\*\* – now available at \[disclaimanddisclose.com\]. It’s a true story that dives deep into the chaos of the Dot Com boom and bust, but also much more.

While it reveals the financial manipulation and fraud I witnessed firsthand in the equities markets, this isn’t just a financial exposé. It's also a personal story—about trauma, family, and the long journey to healing and justice.

If you're into books that blend:

✅ Gripping financial crime from an insider’s view

✅ Firsthand history of the Dot Com bubble

✅ Deeply personal reflection on trauma and resilience

Then this might resonate with you.

You can read the \*\*first 10 chapters free\*\* here: [disclaimanddisclose.com](http://disclaimanddisclose.com)

What if your girlfriend was an AI… and she was built to kill for you?,"Hey everyone. I just dropped a brutal new sci-fi novel called What He Made Me.

It’s about Jen01 — a hyperrealistic AI built for love… but her owner turns her into something darker. A killer. The story takes a deep dive into emotional manipulation, self-awareness, betrayal, and revenge.

Think Ex Machina meets Dexter — with a feminine rage twist.

"All About The Blood - dark, steamy, and indie","Vanessa can’t get sick. Can’t be injured.
She just wants answers—alone.
But Leo, Calmont’s quarterback with a rage problem, wants her.
And when obsession meets mystery, their chemistry might destroy them both.

_______________________________________

I personally love a good college romance (especially with a sports trope). I also enjoy dark romances with obsessions. Contemporary romance? Yes, please. I like sci-fi, but I hate when it takes over the entire story.

I want something: 
Dark 
Contemporary 
Dual POV 
Indie 
A bit of sci-fi 
And STEAMY 🔥

""All About The Blood"" written by... well, me (AKA Taylor Renée)... is all of the above! This eBook is only $4.99 on multiple platforms. 

You've got the concise summary, let me give you the real one:

Vanessa Doe is a biochemistry major with a secret. She flees an abusive foster home for Calmont University's biology labs; desperate to uncover the answers to why she can't get sick or be injured. She's not about to let the obsessive heir to the university distract her—no matter how handsome he is. Leo Calmont is the star quarterback with anger issues. Smothered under his father's overbearing control, he locks onto student trainer Vanessa as his latest obsession. She brings a sense of calm to him he's never found outside of his secret love for literature.

_______________________________________

Themes & content warnings:

This book dives deep into trauma, desire, and survival. It includes SA and physical assault (not between the leads), explicit scenes, and morally gray characters. Think: dark romance meets twisted coming-of-age.

First Book! The Laurels of Glory: A Novel of Ancient Rome,"**""Mars defend you, and Fortuna bring you victory!""**  
  
Rome's wild northern frontier has been overrun by a host of migratory Gauls. The western provinces, and even Italy itself, are under threat. The brand new 13th legion is raised to confront the crisis, and five young scions of the Republic's foremost families are appointed as its tribunes. This first step on the military ladder brings with it the promise of glory in battle, election to high office, and a hero's welcome back in Rome. But dreams turn to ash when a disastrous engagement leaves the 13th disgraced and its tribunes humiliated. Spurned by lovers, scorned by superiors, and rejected by their illustrious aristocratic families, the tribunes of the unlucky 13th must find a way to redeem their tarnished honor and win back the laurels of glory**.**  
  
Set against the backdrop of the tumultuous 1st century BC, *The Laurels of Glory* brings the Roman legion in the age of Caesar to life in vivid, colorful detail. Weaving together original Latin sources and modern scholarship into a timeless tale of honor, loyalty, brotherhood, and coming of age.

Jurassic Age Mage: Welcome to the Jungle: A Magical Self Inflicted Jurassic Age Issekai,"https://a.co/d/eznuZbu

Jurassic Age Mage is a book about a mad scientist who accidentally isekais himself into a world of dinosaurs, elves, and insane magic creatures. He needs to survive while be hunted by those who want the secrets to interdimensional travel. Things only get more complicated when he learns a truth behind reality that many have no idea about...

Blurb: His goals are modest: survive, rebuild his tech, figure out what flavor of cosmic whoopsie flung him here, and avoid being turned into jungle jerky by whatever eldritch nightmare is currently hunting him. Oh, and maybe learn how to wrangle the local mana before it sets his eyebrows on fire again. (Third time’s the charm?)

Along the way, Traebus inadvertently declares war on a flock of bioluminescent raptors, discovers a tribe of surprisingly judgmental triceratops, and has a spirited debate with a malfunctioning mana crystal that may or may not be plotting to explode. With sarcasm as sharp as his makeshift spear and a survival plan that mostly involves running and yelling, he’s determined to claw his way back to civilization—or die fabulously trying.

Jurassic Age Mage is a hilarious and high-octane survival fantasy filled with snark, science, spellwork, and prehistoric panic. Perfect for fans of Dungeon Crawler Carl, Rick and Morty, and that one friend who always thinks pressing the glowing red button will fix everything. It won’t. But it will be entertaining.",1,0,2025-07-22,shadowmind0770,NA - Fantasy,1.0

**“The boogeyman of Outer Gods, protector of Earth, humanity’s last stand—Miratheris’s son has returned.”**

Born a prodigy, Ashen Hart moved through life like a golden boy.  
What others worked for, he mastered with ease.

At first, it felt like a blessing. The validation, pride, and accomplishment felt sweet.  
But even honey spoils when you’re drowning in it.

The more success he tasted, the more hollow it all became.  
And when a mysterious power awakened within him, letting him see moments into the future—  
The world lost all color.  
And then all meaning…  
Nothing could surprise him.  
Nothing could move him.  
He spiraled.  
Ashen threw it all away—ambition, love, purpose—  
and embraced the slow death of apathy.

But fate wasn’t done with him.  
Kidnapped by a shadowy organization and forced into a hidden war,  
he learned the brutal truth:  
he wasn’t special. He was fodder.

Cannon meat to delay the inevitable.

But somewhere, buried beneath sloth and cynicism,  
the genius stirred.  
The apathy rotted away.  
And Ashen Hart, the failure, became Ashen Hart, the wretched.  
The unkillable.

From a discarded pawn to the final hope of mankind.  
And when it was over—when even the gods had fallen—  
he was left alone.

At his dying breath, the Earth’s spirit, Miratheris, answered his plea.  
She rewound time, giving him one last shot.  
But not without a price.

She kept his memories intact… and delayed their return just enough so his younger self could bear the weight.

Ashen’s second life begins now—  
and the monsters, both within and beyond, are about to learn what regret truly feels like.

This book is a tale of a devil (Legions) who oversees legions of demons. It takes place in a text message meeting between Legions and several of the demons in which he oversees. Their objective is to bring immediate torment and eternal damnation to their subjects (humans) in which each of them are assigned. The meeting is to learn new soul accumulation techniques from each other and to learn some of the tried and true techniques that have been used for generations.

This book might make you question some of the less than pleasing thought and events in your life and just who might be the author of such events. It also opens a look at those you know who might seem or act in questionable ways from time to time.

This book is a take on an old-time favorite, The Screwtape Letters by C. S. Lewis, with a modern day twist in a modern day style of communicating.

In 1930, Venice was a city with its own rhythm of life, outward-looking and thriving. The railway bridge and waterbuses to the mainland were the only links to the rest of the world.

Rachele Modiano Mendes, a lawyer at the Venier-Zanin law firm, revises three contracts that contain the same clause. Borrowers had to use a specific shipping company, Fonda Trasporti, until they had fully repaid their loan. She is trying to figure out the reason behind the clause when the managing director, Enrico Fonda, is found dead the day her brother and one of her clients met him.

Rachele must find out who killed Enrico Fonda; it is the best way to protect her client and her brother. Meanwhile, she receives a phone call from a Swiss police inspector asking for her co-operation.

Who killed Enrico Fonda? What was the connection between the lending bank and the shipping company? Why do the Swiss police ask for her cooperation?

Wrote my first book called FogHaven,"Technically I published this several months ago but didn't know this sub existed then. So anyways, I wrote my first book, FogHaven:

In a certain town, a mysterious fog exists that grants cryptic visions of one's death. A writer goes in to investigate, but is he prepared for what he'll learn in this town of mystery and death?

It's a mystery with an added fantastical element. It's a novella that's pretty short. It's technically part of a trilogy but this first book is pretty much a standalone story.

Published my debut!,"It's book 1 of 3 and I'm very proud of myself for putting in the work!

It's a romantasy between a sheltered, hopeful uni student with religious trauma and a grumpy gargoyle. I'm a big fan of monster-lovin' so I wrote a real MONSTER of a gargoyle. < 3 (I think so, anyways~)

I've taken a lot of inspiration from the old folktales and DnD for my original monsters, and my magic system is inspired (but more loosely than the monsters) by 5.5e.

It's first person perspective, which is what I'd read does best in the romance/romantasy genres. It does have a few chapters from the gargoyle love interest's perspective, though. If anyone's willing to give it a try, I hope you enjoy it!

https://a.co/d/0XAone3

Overview:
""I was hanging from my arms, but thinking about my life made it feel more like I was hanging from my neck.""
I'm Ren, a senior in geology, and I've got one year left before graduating university. One night closing up the library on campus, an enormous, gargoyle-come-to-life with glowing eyes saves me from being assaulted. Surely, this is the guardian angel I've been waiting for all of my life, right? No matter what he looks like. I mean, how else does he know details about me he shouldn't? Like my name, that I've been looking for a way to escape beneath my parents' oppression for years, and that I've got a penchant for magic. Wait, seriously? He'll teach me magic in exchange for helping him? He seems like a dream too good to be true. Oh gosh, now that I think about it, this better not be a demon trying to trick me into entering a covenant with them.

""Never in my lengthy existence had I felt this way for a living creature.""
It was humiliating that I had been bested by a thief, but to then get snared in my pursuit was nigh unforgivable. Trapped as I am, I'm unable to return home, but able to move between the World Barrier separating our realms. Seeking aid from a human was my only recourse. I had read up on humans, and as I expected, she was unpredictable and energetic. I hadn't expected her to be so enchanting, so perspective-altering. In her I had hoped to find a tool with which to pry myself free, but I was quickly getting more, so much more, than I had bargained for.",12,8,2025-07-20,InkyBrush,Adult - Romance - Fantasy,0.93

After months of research, writing, and rewriting, I finally hit Publish on my first ebook – ""Toxic Cure"".

It’s an unbiased and informational deep-dive into THC – not glorifying, not demonizing – but questioning why it’s become so widespread among young people, and how society, politics, and perception are shaping its use.

I cover things like:

How THC became a cultural symbol for rebellion

Why it's being used unconsciously by teens & youth

Global political reactions to its rising popularity

A big-picture perspective: is it truly medicine or myth?

I'm not trying to preach – just to open up a conversation.

"Transformation, Vulnerability and Finding My Voice… raw Memoir","Hey Reddit family,

After Two Decades in an Abusive Marriage to a locally, well-known and loved Church Music Minister, I'm Sharing My Story of Healing and Faith in ""Ex'POSED."" It took me another 25 years to heal and walk through this open door of becoming an author, but it came by standing in front of God's mirror, not my own.

I'm Cyndy Lantz, and I'm deeply grateful for this space where authors can share their work. My memoir, **Ex'POSED**, is a raw and honest look at my journey through two decades of an abusive marriage to a music minister in a large church. It covers everything from his many infidelities, all to my supposed close friends and a near-fatal shotgun incident to battling life-altering health challenges and overcoming many of them.

Writing this book was a crucial part of my own healing. In **Ex'POSED**, I open up about finding spiritual and emotional wellness, sharing faith-based wisdom that helped me cultivate a healthier relationship with God, food, and my body. It's about trusting God's plan, confronting past pain, and ultimately finding your voice and freedom.

My hope is that my story inspires others to break free from their own chains of the past, embrace vulnerability, and live a life ""Ex'POSED"" to God's fullest potential... to your fullest potential. I welcome questions and comments, would love to know your thoughts and thank you for allowing me to share my story and encourage you at the same time. Love always... Cyndy

"Buy a Book, Change a Life—$1 Goes Straight to Charity. (My Novel)","Hello everyone, my name is Peyton Lanclos.  
If you have a moment, I’d love to share something close to my heart: my debut novel In Limbo and the mission behind it.

Let me start with the story:

In Limbo Blurb:  
Colt Carlin had one plan: tell his best friend Mia how he feels. But a tragic accident leaves them comatose, and their souls are cast into Limbo—a mysterious realm caught between life and death, where emotions take shape, memories turn hostile, and the past refuses to stay buried.

As Colt uncovers the truth about his father’s celestial past and the strange powers awakening within him, he is pulled into a conflict between divine forces, led by the tyrannical Cain and a fractured resistance struggling to restore balance. When Mia is dragged into the chaos, Colt will risk everything to protect her, even if it means losing himself all over again.

As the boundaries of fate begin to unravel, love becomes the spark that could tip the balance or destroy them both.

In Limbo is a powerful blend of supernatural mystery, emotional grit, and cosmic mythology. It is a story about the ties that bind us, the pain that shapes us, and the impossible lengths we go to for love.

The Mission:  
For every copy sold, I donate one dollar to The SAFE Project, a national nonprofit committed to ending the addiction epidemic and supporting families affected by substance abuse. Supporting this story also means supporting a cause I deeply believe in.

How to Read:

In Limbo is available for free through Kindle Unlimited

A digital copy is available for $3.99 Through Amazon

A Hardcover Copy Is Available For 16.99 Through Amazon

I am also happy to email a free copy to some readers in exchange for an honest review on Amazon or Goodreads!

I just published my short erotic story on Kindle - Two Glasses. One Secret.,"Hi everyone,

This is my first post here and also my very first self-published short story on Kindle. It’s a sensual and mysterious piece I wrote under my pen name, Selena Varela.

The story is titled Two Glasses. One Secret.
It follows an elegant, seductive rendezvous at a stylish bar, where two characters engage in a teasing game of control, champagne… and secret desires.

I’ve always been fascinated by storytelling that leaves room for the reader to insert their own fantasies — and that’s the approach I took. It’s short, erotic, and intentionally open-ended.

It’s free for a limited time, and I’d love to know what you think if you happen to check it out.

[WWII] A lost memoir of survival and love during the Japanese occupation of Manila — just published by their grandson,"In the closing days of World War II, my grandparents, Frank and Virginia Hewlett, sat down to record what they had just lived through — a war story that reads more like a miracle.

Frank was a war correspondent with General MacArthur’s press corps and the last journalist to report from Bataan before it fell. Virginia, his wife, was trapped behind enemy lines, interned at the Santo Tomas camp in Manila for three harrowing years. They were separated by an ocean and the chaos of war, but never gave up hope of finding each other again.

They wrote their memoir in 1946, but it was never published due to the sheer amount of similar stories flooding the postwar publishing world. So it sat, forgotten in family storage, until I, their grandson, stumbled across a fragile manuscript with rice paper pages and margin notes in their handwriting. Over the last few years, I’ve transcribed, edited, and restored their words into a complete book: **The Miracle at Santo Tomas**.

This is not just a war story. It is a story of internment, survival, and a nearly impossible reunion. It is also a personal tribute to the thousands of civilians — especially women — who were imprisoned and endured the occupation of the Philippines.

I wrote a book!,"Hey Reddit,

I wanted to share something deeply personal: I’ve written a poetry memoir called Pretty Pills.

Pretty Pills is the story of my life told through poems- the beautiful, the ugly, the heartbreaking, and the healing. It’s about growing up in a small Texas town, surviving abuse, addiction, coming out, love, heartbreak, and figuring out who the hell I am.

The title comes from how I used to see pills during my addiction. They felt like they were making my life prettier, softer, easier. But they weren’t. They were killing me slowly, stealing pieces of me I’m still trying to get back.

I wrote this book because writing is how I heal. It’s how I process everything I’ve survived and everything I’ve become. I’ve lived through things I thought would destroy me- childhood trauma, sexual abuse, addiction, heartbreak, divorce- and somehow I’m still here. Still writing. Still trying.

This book isn’t just about darkness, though. It’s about finding light. It’s about dogs who saved me. It’s about my sisters. It’s about Denver and the mountains. It’s about loving men, being loved badly, and finally learning what real love looks like. It’s about my mom, who hurt me and who I still miss more than I can say.

I wrote Pretty Pills for people who’ve felt broken. For people who’ve hidden parts of themselves. For anyone who’s been through hell and is still clawing their way back to themselves.

If even one person reads it and feels less alone, then it was worth writing.

Thanks for letting me share this piece of my story.

Protectors of the Sacred Circle,"Hey everyone,

I am Jonathan Bridgers and I am an author who just finished my third book “Protectors of the Sacred Circle”. It follows the journey of a young Native American named Tahu.

This story involved following Tahu on his personal growth into earning his role a Protector. I think it will make you sad, happy, and grieve as you follow this journey. I kept it grounded in Native American folk lore and added in my own special twist by adding in other mythology and creatures of the night that try to corrupt the land.

Tahu is going to meet new allies that he will join forces with that I truly think everyone would enjoy.

The ultimate plan for this book series to date is a four book release and depending on the success I can easily expand it out to be more.

I just published my debut novel Intravenous Rage through D2D! I wrote it in the midst of depression after falling out with my dad, and I ended up using everything I was angry about to create a story that explores femininity and family and friendship! 

Blurb:

Sixteen-year-old Annie Peace is the ideal eldest daughter. She takes on the most responsibility on her family’s farm, cares for her siblings, and keeps her emotions in check. At least she did, until a freak accident revealed a power within her that thrives on emotional turmoil—something she had learned to suppress as she got older.

Additionally, she has to worry about surviving high school while working on a farm under the direction of a patriarch determined to ensure his family's success by any means necessary. All the while, she navigates friendship, identity, love, and the supernatural power she inherits, which will uproot everything she knows.

Thanks for reading! :)

Tigers' Quest - Animal adventure - Available on Kindle Unlimited,"[https://imgur.com/a/dljZ0Sj](https://imgur.com/a/dljZ0Sj)

*A young tiger’s fight for survival becomes a journey of courage, loss, and the soul of the wild.*

In the shadowed jungles of India, a young white tiger named Tiggra comes of age amidst joy, rivalry, and the warmth of a close-knit family. But when a human hunting expedition — known to the animals only as the Killers — descends upon the forest, everything changes. The peaceful harmony of the wild is shattered in a single night of violence and fire, forcing Tiggra into a harrowing flight for survival. Separated from his kin, wounded and grieving, he must navigate a world turned upside down, one where every step could lead to discovery — or death.

*Tigers’ Quest* is a stirring and emotionally rich animal fantasy in the tradition of *Watership Down* and *The Call of the Wild*. With its blend of lyrical prose, vivid characters, and spiritual undertones, the story follows Tiggra’s journey not only through the physical wilderness but into the depths of loss, identity, and courage. It is a powerful tale of nature’s beauty and brutality, and one young tiger’s fight to find meaning in a world forever changed.

Tropes: The Reluctant Hero, Man vs. Nature, Spiritual Undertones

Trigger Warnings: Animal death and violence, Parental loss, Hunting and poaching, Blood and injury, Psychological trauma / grief.  Book 1 of 5, however story is encapsulated.

*An irresistible exotic dancer and her beautiful friend learn how delicious it can be to pay a guy back with endless tease and denial.*

Some say revenge is a dish best served cold, but Kat and Marie disagree. These two beautiful friends have come to discover that revenge is a dish best served slow, hot and steamy. Why rush things? After all, the greatest pleasure of revenge—the ingredient that makes it so sweet—is the time spent savoring the delicious defeat of the one you’re paying back.

In, ""Slow Tease, Sweet Revenge"", Kat and Marie join forces to apply this very philosophy to a man who so clearly deserves it: a pushy, arrogant brute who who will stop at nothing - not even violence - to get what he wants. And when he fixates his desire on Kat only to be rebuffed, he lashes out in a way she finds unforgivable.

Kat's revenge? It’s simple. Give the brute a taste of what he wants, only to pull it away at the last possible instant. Kat and Marie find delicious new ways to repeat this formula with each passing chapter, driving our sorry brute to the breaking point while in the process discovering an altogether new pleasure: each other.

"The One Week Writing Workshop: 7 Days to Spark, Boost or Revive Your Novel by Karin Adams  - Non-Fiction/Writing Reference/Fiction Writing Guide - Paperback, Hardcover and Digital Formats","[https://imgur.com/a/NKe6I6F](https://imgur.com/a/NKe6I6F)

Writing a novel takes thought, dedication, and discipline...but that doesn't mean it shouldn't also include a sense of joy... and even *creative fun!* In fact, *wonder and play* may be the missing ingredients in your current approach to writing. So, let's fix that!

My book *The One Week Writing Workshop: 7 Days to Spark, Boost or Revive Your Novel* is an inspiring workshop you can use anytime, anywhere and at your own pace to learn a start-to-finish novel writing method. But more than that, it contains strategies to spark the creative process in you, urging you to play and experiment  - and really dazzle yourself with what you come up with!

I got into fiction writing because I loved the wonder - and frankly the sheer fun! - of creating stories and working at them until the words on the page matched the vision in my mind. I've had five fiction books traditionally published and have offered writing workshops since 2010 to inspire others to find and share their stories. After all this time, I'm convinced that maintaining a sense wonder and fun is the secret to motivation and momentum and getting a big project like a novel off the ground -  and my book is all about helping you find just that!

*The One Week Writing Workshop* has won numerous book awards, including Winner of the 2025 Eric Hoffer Book Award (Best Reference Book), Silver Medalist in the 2025 Ippy Awards (Writing/Publishing), Honorable Mention in the 2024 Writer’s Digest E-Book Awards, and FINALIST in the 2024 Foreword INDIES Book of the Year Awards. Writers are loving the fun and motivation it's injecting back into the process - I hope you'll give it a try, too!

The Awakening (Chronicles of Thothiya Book 1),"***What would you do if, on your thirtieth birthday, the universe handed you its secrets?***  
  
Nabara thought she was just another daughter in a powerful Nubian Egyptian family. But everything changes the night she receives a letter from her mother—a letter that unlocks a truth hidden for decades.  
  
Inside an unremarkable box are seven ancient cards—not meant to predict the future, but to reveal what has always been hidden. Past. Present. Future. Destiny.  
  
As Nabara begins to uncover the power within the cards, the veil between reality and myth begins to unravel. Echoes of the ancient ones, long-buried secrets, and a legacy older than civilization rise to the surface—forcing her to confront everything she believed about herself, her family, and the world.  
  
The Awakening is the first novella in *Chronicles of Thothiya*, an epic fantasy series inspired by Egyptian mythology. This is a story of identity, power, and what happens when truth demands a sacrifice.  
  
If you love slow-burn magic, interwoven timelines, family secrets, and worlds hidden in plain sight with little bit of romance—this is your next obsession.

ChatGPT Wrote This Book - A Modern Sci-Fi Farce,"Looking for a silly, dorky romance to brighten your day? How about a modern scifi-ish farce that leans heavily into themes of Generative AI and VR? Well, look no further than *ChatGPT Wrote This Book*.

&nbsp;

Nathan was the kind of guy who had never fled a crime scene, but today was a bad day. He lost his job, he lost his girlfriend, he drank himself stupid, and he just met the nuttiest girl he had ever laid eyes on. He was ready to make some poor life choices, but facing the consequences was something he may not have been ready for.

&nbsp;

Today was the last day Nathan was a caring, nurturing person, but was he following a dark path, or was he being kept in the dark?

&nbsp;

His antisocial journey of self-discovery will force him to come face-to-sort-of-face with life’s biggest questions. Who are we? Why are we here? Who wrote the @!&#ing book?

&nbsp;

Tropes: VR, AI

&nbsp;

Trigger Warnings: There's a little bit of self-harm, sex, violence, language and LGBTQIA+ content, but not enough of any of them to require a NSFW label. If I had to rate this book for other media it would be T for Teen or PG-13.

Stolen Headstones: One Family's Forgotten Holocaust Story - Narrative Nonfiction,"One night in September 1943, a Jewish mother took her nine-year-old son in one arm and five-year-old daughter in the other and jumped off a moving train to save their lives. Decades later, the town of Fossano, Italy, still celebrates the local heroes who found the mother and her children by the tracks and risked everything to hide them from the Nazis. But the whole story—where they came from and how they got there—remained a mystery until now. 

The past and present converge in this deeply reported narrative as award-winning writer Ari Schneider travels across Europe, retracing his family's Holocaust story amid a global resurgence of far-right nationalism. His journey takes him to a cemetery in Poland where generations of his ancestors were buried, and a new mystery arises.

I just released my debut psychological sci-fi dystopia — The Dissonant Era: Patriarch’s Apocalypse — and wanted to share the journey with the community.

"I just spent the last year writing my first novel, but now that it's finished, I'm having doubts about whether I should self-publish or traditionally publish.","I've been working on this book for what feels like an eternity, pouring my heart and soul into every word. The story is complete, and I'm finally at the point where I have to decide how to get it out to the world. As a writer, I've always been told that traditional publishing is the ""proper"" way to do things, but now that I've seen what those processes are like, I'm not so sure.

  
On one hand, traditional publishing seems like it would be a more legitimate way for me to get my work out there. I mean, who doesn't want their book on the shelves of a major bookstore? It's been a dream of mine since I was a kid, and I feel like this is the closest I'll ever come to making that happen.

  
On the other hand, self-publishing seems like it would give me so much more control over the final product. I've heard horror stories about how little authors get paid in traditional publishing deals, and the fact that my book could be edited or censored without my input is a major turn-off for me.

  
I'm torn between these two options, and I'd love to hear from other writers who have gone through this process. Has anyone else had to make this decision? How did you choose, and what were your experiences like with either route?

  
Edit: I should add that I'm not opposed to traditional publishing per se - I just think that self-publishing gives me the freedom to do things my own way.",1,4,2025-07-11,Illustrious_Stop7537,Adult - Action/Adventure,0.53

Here's the official blurb stuff:

**The singularity has arrived. Early.**  
  
When a wide-eyed young woman turns up on Berkeley professor Thomas Garrison-Muñoz’s doorstep, he wants to help. She seems confused, maybe even traumatized, and as a widower and empty-nester, he is itching to be useful. But he assumes her story—that she is the world’s first nanotech android dispatched to him by her reclusive creator—is pure delusion.

That is, until she slices open her arm to prove that she is, indeed, not human.

The android—Athena—is eager to learn about the world, but Thomas is more worried about keeping her off a dissection table, especially when it becomes evident that she has some extraordinary advantages over Homo sapiens 1.0.

Meanwhile, across the bay in Silicon Valley, mild-mannered Google engineer Sonny Lee and his cheeky hacker buddy Christian Williams have become embroiled in the hunt for a very different kind of artificial intelligence: rogue super algorithms so smart they are able to stealthily rewrite anything on the Internet.

When Sonny and Christian's investigation leads them to Thomas and Athena, they will find themselves pursued by shadowy figures who may be the FBI, the NSA, or just whacko cultists who think the Internet is alive (or all of the above),

Together, they’ll have to figure out the connection between Athena’s improbable emergence into the world and the seemingly omnipresent computer programs infesting the net—and they’ll have to do it before they’re taken out by black-ops assassins.

*//athena//(emergent)* is a fast-paced adventure about making sure that humanity isn't eclipsed in a new era where the line between machine and human intelligence is razor thin.

**“The boogeyman of Outer Gods, protector of Earth, humanity’s last stand—Miratheris’s son has returned.”**

Born a prodigy, Ashen Hart moved through life like a golden boy.  
What others worked for, he mastered with ease.

At first, it felt like a blessing. The validation, pride, and accomplishment felt sweet.  
But even honey spoils when you’re drowning in it.

The more success he tasted, the more hollow it all became.  
And when a mysterious power awakened within him, letting him see moments into the future—  
The world lost all color.  
And then all meaning…  
Nothing could surprise him.  
Nothing could move him.  
He spiraled.  
Ashen threw it all away—ambition, love, purpose—  
and embraced the slow death of apathy.

But fate wasn’t done with him.  
Kidnapped by a shadowy organization and forced into a hidden war,  
he learned the brutal truth:  
he wasn’t special. He was fodder.

Cannon meat to delay the inevitable.

But somewhere, buried beneath sloth and cynicism,  
the genius stirred.  
The apathy rotted away.  
And Ashen Hart, the failure, became Ashen Hart, the wretched.  
The unkillable.

From a discarded pawn to the final hope of mankind.  
And when it was over—when even the gods had fallen—  
he was left alone.

At his dying breath, the Earth’s spirit, Miratheris, answered his plea.  
She rewound time, giving him one last shot.  
But not without a price.

She kept his memories intact… and delayed their return just enough so his younger self could bear the weight.

Ashen’s second life begins now—  
and the monsters, both within and beyond, are about to learn what regret truly feels like.

Debut Book and First in Series of 4: Mid-Love Crisis,"Hi all, I've just published my new book ***Mid-Love Crisis*** on Amazon. It is my first novel, and has actually been almost a 20-year endeavor, as a similar but very different romance described in the book began for me in 2006, which inspired the fictional characters of Raya and Nyck. 

I'd really love to hear your feedback on the book, the storyline, the characters, and the series, which is focused on the main character Raya Bradford.

The book is available on Amazon: [Available now on Amazon!](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mid-love+crisis+rianna+bellini)

Here is a summary: In ***Mid-Love Crisis***, Raya—recently divorced and navigating her forties—believes her wild days are behind her until a chance meeting at an airport throws her into the orbit of Nyck, a suave stranger harboring a web of secrets. As their passion ignites, Raya discovers that falling in love can be both risky and exhilarating.

The Service Mindset,"Hello everyone,

I wrote a book... its called The Service Mindset and you can find it here.

[The Service Mindset](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0FGV5R1CW)

There was a time - following a traumatic brain injury - when I didn't know how to go on, or how to find meaning in a world where I had lost everything - the voice in my own head even felt like it belonged to a stranger.

It took me years to claw my way out of the darkness and this book serves as a compendium of the lessons I wish I had learnt sooner.

This is the book I wish I had when my world felt like it had fallen apart.

I am not looking for it to be a best seller, or to make any money - Lord knows I'm not that good. I just wrote this book because now - more than ever - I thought the world needed to be reminded of some pretty ancient ideas - and if it helps just one person to find their way out of the darkness, then it has done more than I could have ever hoped. 

If anyone fancies checking it out, that would make me very happy and very proud.

Hi everyone,  
After months of writing (and rewriting!), I finally hit publish on my debut fantasy novel — ***We Stayed at Moonshadow Inn***. It’s a heartfelt, bittersweet story about a magical inn, grief, healing, and the power of found family. I poured a lot into this, and I’d be incredibly grateful for any feedback.

Here’s a quick idea of what to expect:  
🪶 cozy fantasy with emotional depth  
🔥 a burned-down inn filled with memories  
🖤 themes of love, loss, and letting go

I wrote a book about DL stories—based on real experiences. 👀,"Hey y’all, I just dropped my first book—a collection of short, true stories about real DL encounters I’ve had. Each chapter’s like its own episode—some emotional, some messy… and some downright explicit.

It’s a mix of raw moments, closeted tension, and the kind of hookups you don’t talk about out loud. I wrote under a pen name (for obvious reasons), but everything in it really happened.

In A Place Like This – Contemporary Romance / Women’s Fiction – Available on Kindle Unlimited,"([Book 1 of Sands And Silence](https://imgur.com/a/qrf2fQU))

*She just wanted silence, but the sea and a stranger had other plans.*  
*Desire, truth… and the one man who truly saw her.*  
*Sometimes, even running away brings you back to yourself.*

Jessica wasn’t looking for love. Or answers. Just an escape.  
Fleeing a suffocating relationship, she checks into a secluded beach resort, convinced that silence and a room with an ocean view will fix her life.

What she didn’t expect was Bastian — the man who seems to understand her without even trying, who looks at her like no one else, and who has no hurry to take her apart.

What starts as a sensual game becomes something far more difficult: because in a place like this, masks don’t stay on for long.

A story about burning bodies, heavy scars, and the decisions we make when we can no longer lie to ourselves.

**Tropes:**  
• beach resort setting  
• emotional healing after heartbreak  
• “the one who really sees you”  
• strangers-to-lovers  
• second chance at self

**Trigger Warnings:**  
• emotional abuse (past, not on-page)  
• mild sexual content (fade-to-black)  
• grief / mention of scars

Hi, everyone! This is my first book, so please be gentle. I wrote most of it in quiet, insightful — and, let’s be honest, probably horny — moments, convincing myself no one would ever actually read it.

It’s a quiet little story about a woman, a beach resort, a stranger, and all the messy feelings we pretend we don’t have. If it sounds like your kind of thing, thanks for giving it a look. If not, thanks for scrolling past and sparing me a panic attack.

domesticity - Short Story and Poetry Collection - FREE on Amazon,"I’ve dropped a new book called [domesticity](https://www.amazon.com/domesticity-poems-stories-Richard-Helmling-ebook/dp/B0FGZJ37GT/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1V7RIWDXSYJME&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.G1SRxEgyebjuJA8Uax5u5A.PUaowUpRWIFSJy2Bah1K8fGPXGqyRbrTbq673lupYCM&dib_tag=se&keywords=helmling+domesticity&qid=1752064808&sprefix=helmling+domesticity%2Caps%2C107&sr=8-1) on Amazon and that it’s currently free to download, with or without Kindle Unlimited. 

This is a collection of stories, poems, and flash fiction spanning, well, pretty much my whole life. A lot of these were previously published in zines, anthologies, or journals and others were posted on my website at some point over the last thirty years, but a few are brand new. 

Here’s what I cooked up for the official blurb:

*In short stories, poems, and flash fiction—some previously published, some never before released—domesticity traces the journey of settling in, of building home, of seeking peace...or something like it.*

*Effortlessly hopping genre and style conventions, the collection sweeps through personal reflections of bristling tension and doubt, to absurdist tongue-in-cheek commentary on societal expectations, and even into far-flung flights of fancy. All circling themes of belonging, legacy, and mortality to argue collectively for making the difficult choice to hope.* 

Arguably a little vague, but it’s because there’s dozens of pieces in here so they’re a little hard to sum up! 

It does include what's probably my favorite short story I’ve ever written Atmospheric Perspective. Daniel Chacon—who is great and you should read—said it was “great fiction” when we workshopped the story. I even thought about asking him to use that quote in the blurb, but since he said it more than fifteen years ago, I didn’t think that was fair. Still, he said it!

Rahna of the Sandsgate - A fantasy novel.,"Hey! I read Reddit all the time, but haven't really posted much of anything at all until now. I guess there's no better time than posting about my new book, Rahna of the Sandsgate. It's a fantasy novel written for young adults and upwards.

'In the searing heat of Kalmarrah, the desert port city where survival is earned one stolen coin at a time, a green-skinned thief dreams of more.

Rahna has always been different, with pointed ears, orange eyes, and no memory of her parents. An orphan scraping by in the slums of the Sandsgate, she's learned to keep her head down and her blade sharp. But when a daring theft starts off a series of events beyond her control, Rahna finds herself on an adventure far beyond Kalmarrah’s walls.

Driven by a need to uncover the truth of her origins, Rahna must leave behind the only home she’s ever known and venture into a world far more strange and dangerous than anything she could imagine. What she discovers along the way could change not only her life, but the fate of the entire city.'

The e-book is available on Amazon and the Kindle App.

Well, I recently wrote a short book and published it through KDP about...a time where I..for better words..almost drove myself off a bridge. The day was long, crying all damn morning, parents didn't notice, alllllll my anxiety and ADHD put me in a state of...let's bring up every bad thing that happened to you and push you over the edge...and boy did it. But I survived cause a huge SEMI blew its horn at me and another car boxed me in. I kid you not, they looked like maniquens to hold me. So my book is about how I came out of that by using my phone to jot down what i was feeling and two entities stayed with me that day...I named them Guardian and Nuisance. 

I wrote this book because some people see people who contemplate suicide as selfish....so I wanted to show people the mind of someone who did contemplate it and see...sometimes its just really dark and hard to come out of especially if it all hits you at once.

The Drakes were Reach’s gamble. Convicted officers with knives behind their smiles. Commander Shaw made them useful. Put a gunship under each one and told them to fly clean.

Now the deal is bleeding out.

The second ship is gone. The first one lied. The third left a corpse with Shaw’s command seal cut into the uniform.

This isn’t desertion. It’s message work. Sabotage with body counts.

To find the truth, Shaw has to chase the oath that bound them. Through false reports, ghost ships, and the political shadows that wanted this deal to fail before it even began.

"Raw Truths from a Chef's Life: Addiction, Passion, and the Lessons That Saved Me","From the Bronx to high volume kitchens, from addiction to recovery, from heartbreak to hope — Chef Moses Hernandez has lived a life behind the line few could imagine. In this raw, deeply personal memoir, Hernandez takes you on a journey through the heat of the kitchen and the chaos of his own struggles.

With honesty as sharp as a chef's knife, he lays bare the price of passion: the sacrifices, the scars, the broken dreams, and the small victories that gave him the strength to keep going. From culinary school highs to moments of crushing loss, from finding love for food to losing — and rebuilding — love for himself, this book is an unflinching portrait of what it really takes to build a life in the kitchen.

More than a memoir, Raw Truths from a Chef's Life is a testament to character, grit, and the human spirit. For anyone who has ever wondered what goes on behind the swinging doors — or inside the heart of a chef — this is a story of resilience, growth, and the healing power of food.

The book is available on all major platforms such Apple Books and Barnes & Noble. Currently on sale for the month of July for Just $1.

📚 I Wrote a Book! P.I. Darling is out now and I can hardly believe it 🔥,"Hi everyone! I just published my debut novel, P.I. Darling, and I am so excited (and a little nervous) to finally share it. This story has been in my head for years, and seeing it out in the world feels surreal.

I first started writing P.I. Darling in a creative writing class in college because I loved noir books, but I always wondered what would happen if the private investigator was a woman instead of the usual male protagonist. That thought stuck with me and became the spark for Ruth Francis Darling, a sharp, witty, and determined private investigator working in 1940s Boston. It has taken me quite a few years to finally finish this book, and now I am so happy to see it out in the world.

I am also currently working on the second book in the series, P.I. Darling: No Rest for the Loyal, so stay tuned for that!

✨ P.I. Darling is a historical mystery set in Boston in 1943. Ruth runs a one-woman private investigation agency. Most of her cases involve cheating spouses and petty thieves, but when a grieving professor swears he saw his brother alive months after his reported death in the war, Ruth is pulled into a web of Nazi espionage, cryptic German notes, and a dangerous figure known only as the Red Eagle.

This book has everything I love about the genre:
✅ A strong and witty female detective
✅ 1940s noir atmosphere with a historical twist
✅ A mystery that keeps you guessing until the last page
✅ Found family, slow-burn romance, and danger around every corner

As an autistic writer who loves historical fiction and strong female leads, I poured my heart into this story. If you enjoy Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries, Veronica Mars, or The Thin Man, you might feel right at home in Ruth’s world.

Letters to the Village - New Memoir,"I just published my first book - Letters to the Village. After long nights of re living some of my worst chapters of life, and years of advocacy work, my story is ready to be told. See summary iand link below. Available now on amazon paperback.

"" What happens when the people meant to raise you… don’t?

In this powerful memoir told through a series of raw, unfiltered letters, Tamara invites readers into the most vulnerable parts of her story—from the pain of childhood abuse and the failures of the foster care system, to the healing she found in unexpected places and people. Each letter is written to someone who left an imprint on her life: the helpers, the hurters, and the bystanders.

Letters to the Village is not just a story of survival—it's a testament to the ripple effects of our actions and inactions. It is a bold call to accountability, a tribute to resilience, and a reminder that we all belong to each other.

Heartbreaking, honest, and ultimately hopeful, this book challenges us to look closely at the roles we play in each other’s lives—and to choose to show up with intention.

What if magic didn’t fix anything? Literary fantasy for the emotionally overcaffeinated.,"I wrote a novel for readers who crave found family, magic that never behaves as you expect, and a little too much heartbreak.

This isn’t a prophecy story. There’s no chosen one. Just a boy who wants answers, a kingdom falling apart, and adults who handle trauma with magic and questionable decisions.

It’s literary prose, not high fantasy. It's strange, sharp, sometimes beautiful, sometimes brutal. If you want dialogue that bites, rituals that never go as planned, and a cast that loves, fights, and fails spectacularly, you’ll find something here.

Expect magic that’s both a problem and a promise. Expect rituals in the kitchen. Expect too much honesty and not enough comfort.

If you like your fantasy a bit sad, a bit clever, and written with actual sentences, come see if this book fits you.

This is the first book in a series, and I promise, things get even stranger from here.

Self Help Guide with AI and Animal Symbols,"I wrote a unique book on how to use AI tools like ChatGPT for self-discovery - including how to prompt it to uncover the animal that best represents your personality.

"F*ck Narcissism - find alignment in people, places and how you show up in life","**F\*ck Narcissism** isn’t another book about how to diagnose someone else’s flaws or spot red flags.  
It’s about breaking mimetic loops, getting clear on your own values, building real boundaries, and finding alignment — in people, places, and how you show up in life.

I wrote this after realizing how much energy I wasted labeling others instead of looking at how I engage, protect, and evolve myself.  
And honestly? I was triggered by all those oversimplified social media posts diagnosing everyone as a narcissist. They felt more harmful than healing.

This book is for anyone tired of the blame game — who’s ready to come back to their own center and live with intention.

It's available as ebook on Amazon and free with Kindle unlimited.

"My Guiding Ember: An emotional fantasy story full of action, self-discovery, and dark secrets – now free on Kindle","Hi everyone,

I just released my debut young adult fantasy novel on Kindle, and it's **free for a limited time**.

**Book Trailer:**  
Zeyn has seen demons his whole life, twisted shadows only he can see. For years, they’ve haunted him, breaking him down piece by piece. Then he meets Zahra, a strange girl with no memory and a flower-shaped mark in her eyes. The moment she touches him, the demons vanish.

Drawn together by a force neither understands, they begin a journey into Zahra’s forgotten past. But some memories carry more than pain, some carry power. And what they find will not only test their bond, but shake the very line between human and demon.

**What to expect**  
This book is **the beginning of a saga,** it’s fast-paced, rich in emotions, and filled with:

* **Courageous rescues**
* **Haunting secrets and plot twists**
* **World-building that’s just getting started**
* **Themes of identity, hope, and healing**

I wrote it for readers who love characters with **internal battles as big as their external ones**. If you enjoy stories where love, loss, and self-discovery collide in magical worlds — this might be for you.

📚 ***Free for now on Amazon (Kindle)(until Sunday 6 jul***)

"Cracking the Code on the Lost Dutchman Mine: How I Uncovered the Truth About the Gold, Maps, and Murder","A Real life Goonies meets Indiana Jones type of adventure, but it's true.

Hey everyone. I just published my first book after spending over a year unraveling a series of real-life mysteries tied to the Lost Dutchman Mine and the Superstition Mountains in Arizona.

It started when my daughter asked me a simple question. I didn’t have an answer, so I started researching. That turned into months of hiking, digging through archives, and connecting the dots between old maps, deaths, newspaper articles, and oral accounts.

Eventually, I found what I believe is the location of the mine. Along the way, I uncovered what may be the real story behind the death of Adolph Ruth and several other long-standing mysteries. I wrote it all down and turned it into a nonfiction book.

The Strangeness of Losing Things and Finding Things - short story collection / surrealism - available on Kindle Unlimited,"So I published a book (not really a book just a short story collection) a little while ago and sort of completely forgot that it existed for a minute — because life. 

It’s called “The Strangeness of Losing Things and Finding Things” and centers around six surrealist / magical realism stories that deal with some kind of loss and finding a way past that loss (oooo such a deep title connection to subject matter).

If you like really odd stuff, check it out. Or don’t. You do you.

-Blurb-

Six stories.

Six souls.

Six searches for some way out of the dark.

A man coming face-to-face with a familiar face.

An unlikely pair stuck in an uncomfortable relationship.

A lost wretch torn between ghosts and monsters and a far-off dream.

A girl trying to make sense of a strange event slithering through her brain.

A woman running from loss — running until reality shatters around her.

A father forced to confront the horrifying inevitability of a cold, dead future.

Journey through this collection of worlds where the meat of normality dissolves, leaving behind nothing but the strange bones beneath — the truth beneath — for these lost wanderers to face.

-trope list-

Surrealism, broken reality, inner demons, probably more but idk how many to put

-trigger warnings-

There's some frightening visuals and some stories touch on sensitive matters like family death and suicide. There's some adult language. Nothing's overly bad I don't think.

Tadpoles in My Jar — YA Coming-of-Age,"I published my debut novel — a patchwork of nostalgia, girlhood, grief, friendship, first love, and that bittersweet, uncomfortable thing called change. I’ve poured my whole heart into this book, all 220 pages of it, into its setting, its characters, the quiet symbolism, and the way little details mean more the longer you sit with them. Tadpoles in My Jar is a nostalgic, coming-of-age story that follows Betty and James, childhood best friends turned lovers, as they navigate the bittersweet mess of growing up. Set in Gallipolis, Ohio in the late '90s, and told through intertwining perspectives, Tadpoles in My Jar captures the tenderness of adolescence and the quiet hope that we can find our way back, not just to a place, but to the people who feel like home.

"A Portrait For Tomorrow - A furry, slice of life story of healing, tragedy, and love","Hello there,
I just published my debut novel, a furry slice of life story that was primarily inspired by the film Harold and Maude.

Blurb: After a failed stint in college, Gerald Waller is a reclusive lion unhappy with his static life. Buried are his desires of being an artist like his late-mother along with the prospect of finding love. When chance connects him with Michael, an optimistic fox with a penchant for the guitar, Gerald begins to see life with a fresh perspective and optimism. With renewed inspiration, Gerald resurrects an ambitious painting project and soon falls in love with Michael. 

But when Michael's health takes a traumatic turn, Gerald's faith is shaken with the growing possibility of losing the love of his life. Balancing between caring for his lover's health, his strained relationship with his father, and progress on his painting, Gerald wonders if he can march forward with all that he's learned and still remain hopeful.

Tropes: Slice of life, contemporary, LGBT, the Polyanna, tear jerker, heartwarming, philosophical, dark and troubled past, deceased parents are the best

Content Warnings: Suggestive sexual themes, alcohol abuse, medical trauma, and a suicide attempt

"The Musician's Gold Mine: Skills, Strategies, and Secrets for a Successful Music Career","I've been a professional musician/performer and songwriter for 20+ years. Berklee College of Music Alumnus. Knew what I wanted to do for a living since I was 14. 

I perform approx 125 shows per year and my gigs range from local breweries, to intimate listening room concerts, to private events and occasionally opening for major artists. After having many discussions with (frustrated) musician colleagues who where unhappy with their music careers, I realized everything I've learned in two decades of doing this (many concepts and business strategies I considered ""normal"" or ""common knowledge"") was anything but. 

So when my baby was born and it was incredibly hard to find quiet time to write and record music, I spent the last 15 months writing the book I wish someone would have given me at the start of my career. 

It combines music business, marketing/branding, overcoming self-doubt (I call it ""Silencing Your Inner Bitch""), and actual music lessons. This book is full of the most monumental things that have helped me build a successful indie music career. I wrote it to save other musicians time and money, and to help them earn more and work smarter to get further, faster.

I crammed as much value as I possibly could into this book, and I wrote it in a way you could open to any topic or section at random, and find something valuable you could institute today, to further your career. The music lessons section (Part 5) is full of cool songwriting tips, unique scales and chords you probably haven't hear of, and even mosaic theory, ear training and modal stuff...things you can literally learn and incorporate in one sitting. 

The book has only been out for 3 weeks, and to my surprise, has hit #1 on Amazon's New Releases in the *Songwriting* and *Music Business* categories. Thats not the end-all-be-all, but it feels like a win to me, since it proves people are finding value from it. 

Paperback is $20 and its available in all English-speaking countries via Amazon. eBook is $9.99 (also on Amazon). Here's a link for anyone interested. I added a lot of humor to the book (tried to have it read like you are sitting down with a musician friend who is sharing gig stories, life/career lessons and all kinds of helpful music career knowledge...sometimes funny (plenty of toilet humor), sometimes painful, always honest. It's obviously geared at musicians but I wrote it to be entertaining for non-musicians too, basically for fans of music and people curious about the industry and life as a musician. 

In my opinion as a long-time professional, it's tens of thousands of dollars worth of value for $20. I've never worked on something so hard in my life and I'm really happy with how it turned out. I'd be honored if any of you even free-sampled it on Amazon to see if it's up your ally. Would be a great gift for any musician friend or family member in your life. 

Happy to answer any questions anyone has on the process as well. I had to learn a ton of new skills and a lot about a new industry overall over the last year and change. I'd love to share anything that may help any of you. Anyone who took the time to read all this...thank you

Danny Spank unleashes a torrent of unfiltered madness—a visceral, stream-of-consciousness descent into a mind teetering between genius and ruin. Part memoir, part manifesto, this relentless narrative weaves a tapestry of addiction, betrayal, and unquenchable rage against a world that’s stolen his dues. From the highs of crafting billion-dollar screenplays to the lows of dope-sick despair, Spank lays bare a life fueled by heroin, heartbreak, and a vendetta against pop icon Ariana Grande, who he claims poisoned his soul and pilfered his fortune. Amidst the wreckage of love lost to Hannah, philosophical rants, and visions of a cult rising from his art, this book is a jagged mirror reflecting the cost of creation in a universe devoid of justice. Unapologetic, disjointed, and dripping with dark humor, it’s a suicide note, a love letter, and a middle finger to conformity—a cult classic for the broken and the bold.",2,0,2025-06-29,OkObject8421,Adult - Contemporary Fiction,1.0
"Just finished and published my first fantasy novel. No magic powers. No chosen one. Just pain, memory, and invention.","Hey folks,  
After a lot of doubt, edits, and rewrites, I finally published my debut fantasy novella., short but focused. I wanted to share it here, not just to promote, but because finishing this was a real win for me.

The book is called *The Hero Is Not Coming*.

It follows Edmund, a prince born without magic in a kingdom that barely acknowledges him. What no one knows is that he remembers a past life where he failed to save the world. This time, he’s determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

He’s not powerful. He’s not respected. But he’s brilliant. He hides in a royal forge, quietly inventing rune-powered tech the world isn’t ready for. Radios. Tablets. And something much worse.

This isn’t a story about being chosen. It’s about building a way out when the world has closed every door. Quiet, slow-burn, emotional, with themes of guilt, control, and survival.

Brushstrokes Beneath Tropical Skies: A Billionaire's Paradise - Romance Novel,"When billionaire Markus Black sought refuge from the chaos of his corporate empire, he found peace in seclusion—on a private tropical island, far from the demands of the world. But everything changes the day a castaway washes ashore.

Veronica Hayes, a renowned New York artist desperate for inspiration, never imagined her artistic retreat would leave her stranded. What she expected to be a disaster became the spark of something extraordinary—a journey of rediscovery, passion, and awakening.

As Veronica paints the vivid colors of Markus’s island paradise, their worlds begin to merge: his structured empire and her free-spirited artistry. In each other, they find what they were missing—authenticity, connection, and purpose.

From the golden beaches of a billionaire’s escape to the bustling streets of New York’s art scene, Canvas of Us is a sensual and emotional romance about finding yourself through the eyes of another—and painting a love story neither of them saw coming.

They're baaaaccck!  Fletcher Rand's band of madly skilled ex-misfits is back together again, this time to match wits with a megalomaniac who is keen on bringing back Eden. A fresh start for one, maybe two people, but a real bummer for the other 8.5 billion humans. 

Their movable feast gets some help from some noble beasts, because everybody likes a safe neighborhood.  It's an action/adventure/philosophical/comedy like Book One, with some rom-com sprinkled on top. 

This is Book Two of the Society Series, with Book Three on tap for your Labor Day reading pleasure.  

Book One:

[The 7th Wave: The Society Series-Book One ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7HYVLS3)chronicles Fletcher Rand's ad hoc band of brothers and sisters' first madcap mission together. To rescue one of their own, the ex-president’s daughter, Lola Lydon. Their fellowship grows as they battle their way up the criminal food chain, crossing paths with the Connecticut pirate Francis Delacroix, the Thai warlord Hung (the Big Awesome) Phat, the Indian polymath Marjhang (the Slim Buddha) Singh, and finally Eva (WTF?) Pavlova. 

A thrilling journey, like *Odysseus* on a bullet train, but without Odysseus, or the train. Ten times more readable, and a shedload funnier than Homer.  
  
Johnny and Jeb, two young and yet old friends, founded the Earth Liberation Foundation with fellow nepo-monied Anna, initially to work off the guilt that came with being endowed with great wealth for the unwitting feat of being born.  Same as Lola's childhood bestie, who was protected by Ariel, whom had befriended Kiko before running into Francis, and then Captain Billy on the way to meeting the pearl dropping Hung, who dispatched them to the happiness loving Marjhang, attracting ex-President Jack, Agent Walshie, Fixer Fletcher, and the Pentagon's own Baby Eagle One, Vinnie Sombrotto. Which led the gang to Angry Eva and Outsized Aleksi and Company. And of course, the Russian guy, Yuri, and the sprightly old fighter pilot friend, Colonel Vines.

New Book Exposes the “Dark Side of the Rainbow” Theory,"Is it real, a cosmic coincidence, an ingenious marketing ploy, or just another conspiracy theory?

What are the chances that one of the most beloved movies of all time is artistically linked to one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded? For the uninitiated, the “Dark Side of the Rainbow” theory (also known as [The Dark Side of Oz](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DXVND79V)) asserts that Pink Floyd purposely synchronized *The Dark Side of the Moon* to *The Wizard of Oz*. For those who have seen it, the mashup produces dozens of striking coincidences between the film and the album, where actions on the screen seemingly correspond to the lyrics, chords and musical moods of the Dark Side tracks.

In addition to a complete viewing guide for the synchronicities, the book explores an explanation for their existence:

* Pink Floyd had the means: they had ample experience scoring films.

* They had the motivation: the band continuously sought visual presentations of their songs during concerts.

* In the late 1990s, mainstream media outlets published reports that Pink Floyd had been threatened with a lawsuit by MGM if they used clips of *The Wizard of Oz* during concerts.

* Did Pink Floyd leave veiled clues on subsequent albums?

I wrote a fantasy novel where the prince has no magic — so he builds rune-powered weapons instead,"Hey everyone,

After years of scribbling scenes in notebooks and obsessing over magic systems, I finally launched the first book in my epic fantasy series, *The Hero Is Not Coming*.

It’s about Edmund, a prince reborn without magic in a kingdom where power *is* magic. He’s cast out, enslaved, and nearly erased from history. But instead of waiting for fate or prophecy, he builds. He remembers a life where he failed to stop the fall of civilization, and this time, he’s using invention to change the outcome.

Rune-powered rifles. Arcane radios. Even early magical artillery. And under it all: trauma, rebellion, and a dangerous alliance with a beast-blooded princess who might be divine.

If you’re into low-magic worldbuilding, political fantasy, or flawed heroes who rebel quietly, this might be your thing.

"Polylogical Thinking: How to Make Sense of Conflicting Ideas and Perspectives in Personal Life, Relationships, Work, and Society","**Nonfiction | Self-Help**

Whether in making personal decisions, in relational disharmony, professional conflicts, societal challenges, or international warfare – complexity is a constant.

Each participant involved in the conflict or a plan has a story from their perspective.

The traditional problem-solving practice of sharply dissecting the situation and deciding what is ‘exactly right’ and what is ‘exactly wrong’ is insufficient. Doing so oversimplifies the situation, fails to consider everyone’s story, silences the minority or the weak, and misses the big picture. Consequently, we, as the architects of our society, contribute in a mediocre and unjust creation.

The solution to the complexity is not the sharp dissection of the situation and finding the answers in binary – Right vs. Wrong, Good vs. Bad, Us vs. Them.

Instead, it is to understand the multiple stories from all perspectives; hold them in dynamic tension long enough until everyone’s voice is heard, a big picture is emerged, and we get sufficient information of the situation based on which we can find the solutions that benefit everyone without injustice or tyranny.

This scientifically-backed book ‘*Polylogical Thinking*’ offers a practical, actionable framework for making sense of multiple, contradictory perspectives. Based on systems theory, cognitive flexibility, and ethical pluralism, this book offers a proper way of thinking which applies to all aspects of life – personal decision-making, relationships, professional settings, society, international situations.

A Must-Read for anyone who acknowledges the life’s complexity, and wishes to face the conflicts wisely, not impulsively.

**Sample Articles from the book**:

**Beyond Dualism**

Every day, we encounter people who see the same issue from vastly different angles—what one calls freedom, another calls chaos; what one sees as progress, another sees as erosion. These divergent views are not mere noise or distraction. They are clues. They reveal the complex, layered nature of human meaning-making. Polylogical thinking begins by taking such multiplicity seriously—not as a problem to solve, but as a reality to navigate.

Unlike binary frameworks that sort the world into neat categories, polylogical thinking recognizes that most truths do not exist in isolation. They co-exist, overlap, and sometimes contradict. Each perspective arises from a unique interplay of experience, context, history, identity, and values. To think polylogically is not to abandon clarity but to deepen it by learning to hold more than one valid perspective at the same time.

*“The world does not ask us to choose a side. It asks us to learn how to stand where many sides meet.”*

 The existence of multiple perspectives is not a flaw in reasoning—it is a reflection of the varied human conditions under which knowledge forms. Culture, geography, language, power structures, trauma, and lived experience all shape how we interpret reality. When two individuals view the same situation and arrive at different conclusions, it does not necessarily mean one is wrong. It often means each is right within the framework of their own world.

This multiplicity has evolutionary roots. Anthropological studies show that human groups have always relied on distributed intelligence—different members contributing varied skills, insights, and knowledge—to survive and adapt. Diversity in viewpoint was an asset, not a liability. In modern times, this legacy continues. In science, for example, competing theories often coexist until new paradigms emerge that unify them or dissolve their oppositions. In law, plural interpretations of justice inform dynamic and living systems of jurisprudence. In democratic societies, disagreement is not a failure of consensus but a sign of a healthy plurality of voices.

*“Where we see contradiction, life often hides coordination waiting to be uncovered.”*

 Consider public debates on climate change, immigration, or artificial intelligence. These are not debates with one correct answer and one incorrect one. They are conversations across worldviews, value systems, and risk calculations. What looks like resistance is often a reflection of differing priorities, histories, or lived costs. Polylogical thinking urges us to approach such debates not to win, but to understand—what truth is this perspective holding that others might be missing?

This stance requires more than tolerance. It demands curiosity, cognitive humility, and emotional maturity. We must learn not only to hear different perspectives but to ask: *What conditions made this perspective reasonable to the person holding it?* In doing so, we shift from judging positions to mapping them—charting the terrain of thought, rather than policing its boundaries.

Such an approach is not relativism. Polylogical thinking does not imply that all viewpoints are equally valid in all contexts. Rather, it means that multiple valid partial truths can coexist, each offering something essential, even if incomplete. The goal is not to flatten complexity into a false middle but to build a fuller understanding by integrating contrasting insights.

In education, this approach means teaching students to examine an issue through political, economic, psychological, and ecological lenses—not to confuse them, but to equip them with the ability to think systemically. In leadership, it means moving beyond simplistic solutions and learning to work within tensions—balancing innovation with caution, individuality with belonging, short-term needs with long-term vision. In relationships, it means listening to the meaning behind the words, not just the content of disagreement.

When multiple perspectives are made visible, conflict can give way to creativity. Systems that foster dialogue among differing viewpoints—rather than silencing or resolving them prematurely—tend to be more adaptive and resilient. These systems generate novel solutions precisely because they host contradictions rather than eliminate them.

The importance of multiple perspectives is particularly evident in multicultural societies. Here, every issue intersects with layers of language, memory, power, and pain. Applying a single lens to such complexity is not only insufficient—it is often harmful. Polylogical thinking provides the tools to engage these intersections with respect, awareness, and depth. It helps us understand why our disagreements are not just semantic but stem from deeper structural and existential differences.

To move beyond dualism is to accept that truth is not a single beam of light, but a spectrum. Each perspective refracts reality differently, revealing aspects invisible to others. Our challenge is not to blend these into a dull gray, but to learn how to see the full range of color they offer. Only then can we begin to grasp the richness of the world and the dignity of those who experience it differently than we do.

֍ 

**The Polylogical Framework**

The framework of polylogical thinking offers a powerful alternative to conventional modes of reasoning, especially in a world characterized by complexity, diversity, and conflict. At its core, this framework moves beyond simple binary oppositions and linear cause-effect models, embracing instead a multidimensional approach that can hold multiple perspectives simultaneously without forcing premature closure or false harmonization. It provides a structured way to engage with complexity in thought, dialogue, and decision-making.

Polylogical thinking’s framework rests on several foundational principles that define its cognitive architecture. First is the principle of ***multiplicity***, which recognizes that reality and truth often exist in multiple, sometimes contradictory forms. This principle rejects the reduction of complex issues into single “right” answers and encourages openness to diverse viewpoints as valid and informative. Rather than seeing contradictions as obstacles, polylogical thinking treats them as essential clues to deeper understanding.

Closely linked to multiplicity is the principle of ***contextuality***. Every perspective, opinion, or piece of information emerges from a specific context—cultural, historical, emotional, or situational. The polylogical framework insists on situating ideas within their broader context, avoiding decontextualized judgments. This helps prevent oversimplification and acknowledges that what may seem contradictory can be coherent when viewed from different angles or layers of context.

A third fundamental principle is ***relationality***, which highlights the interconnectedness of ideas, people, and systems. Polylogical thinking understands that perspectives are not isolated; they influence and shape each other dynamically. This principle encourages weaving these perspectives together into a complex relational network rather than treating them as separate or opposing camps.

Finally, the framework incorporates ***dynamic integration***, an ongoing process rather than a fixed state. It does not demand the merging of conflicting views into a single synthesis but fosters the ability to hold multiple truths in tension, enabling a flexible, evolving understanding. This dynamic process allows for adaptation and growth, reflecting the fluid nature of knowledge and reality.

Together, these principles create a scaffold for polylogical thinking that encourages deep engagement with complexity and nuance. This framework supports cognitive flexibility and emotional equanimity, essential for navigating real-world problems that resist simple solutions.

To illustrate the polylogical framework in practical terms, consider the challenge of addressing climate change. Traditional debates often polarize into economic growth versus environmental protection. Binary thinking demands choosing one side, ignoring the legitimate concerns embedded in both. A polylogical approach, by contrast, recognizes that economic development and environmental sustainability are interconnected and context-dependent issues. It explores multiple perspectives simultaneously: the needs of communities dependent on industry, the urgency of ecological preservation, the role of technology, and the socio-political factors influencing policy. Through this multidimensional engagement, more adaptive and inclusive solutions can emerge, ones that respect the complexity rather than deny it.

*""True understanding unfolds not in choosing sides, but in holding many truths in the space between them.""*

 Another example is found in interpersonal conflict. Often, disagreements escalate because parties expect exclusive truth or rightness. Polylogical thinking invites participants to recognize the validity of multiple emotional realities and interpretations within the same conflict. This approach does not trivialize differences but opens a relational space where contradictions coexist and inform deeper empathy and creative resolution.

Scientific and philosophical traditions underpin this framework. Systems theory, for instance, provides a formal basis for understanding relationality and contextuality, showing how components of a system interact dynamically and cannot be fully understood in isolation. Cognitive science research on *cognitive flexibility* aligns with polylogical thinking’s emphasis on mental agility—the capacity to shift perspectives, tolerate ambiguity, and integrate conflicting information without distress. Neuroscience reveals that the brain has the capacity for complex, multi-layered processing, supporting the possibility of polylogical cognition beyond simple dualistic patterns.

This framework enables us to transcend polarized thinking and engage with complexity authentically. It invites us to cultivate a mental posture that is humble yet courageous, open to uncertainty yet grounded in rigorous inquiry.

*""Holding contradiction is not weakness; it is the strength to think in full color where others see only black and white.""*

The polylogical framework thus provides a vital mental operating system for the twenty-first century, equipping us to navigate conflicts, collaborate across divides, and generate innovative solutions that honor the richness of reality.

Gravity's End: A Hard Sci-fi Novel in Space - Available on Kindle Unlimited," 

[https://imgur.com/a/7k7gBCJ](https://imgur.com/a/7k7gBCJ)

Hi everyone,

I recently finished writing a sci-fi novel called *Gravity’s End*, and I’d love to share the core idea with you—along with a question that’s been stuck in my mind for a while.

👉 *If you could choose your child's height through genetic engineering, would you pick shorter than average, average, or taller than average?*  
👉 *And what happens if everyone makes the same choice?*

In *Gravity’s End*, I explore a future where genetic enhancements become commonplace. Parents, trying to give their kids a social or economic advantage, start choosing taller and taller heights.

As generations pass, the average human height starts rising dramatically—until gravity itself becomes a problem. Infrastructure cracks. The human body begins to fail. The world has to confront a strange dilemma: How tall is too tall?

The book deals with themes like:

* Human ambition and hubris
* The ethics of genetic design
* Man vs. machine
* The unintended consequences of optimization
* Apocalyptic futures born from good intentions

I’d love to hear your thoughts—does this sound like a plausible future to you?  
Have you read (or written) stories that explore a similar idea?

Happy to answer any questions or dive deeper into the world of the book. Just glad to be part of a community that gets excited by ""what if?""

* Tropes: Human hubris, Man vs. machine, genetic engineering, apocalypse. 

 

Trigger Warnings: The book references acts of war, but contains no graphic descriptions of battle scenes.

*Did you ever see a time loop movie/story, and wondered what happens after? Once the MC is free, but they retain all the knowledge and experience?*

When he found himself in an alternate version of the USA, with geography that barely made sense, and history so similar yet so different, Alexander thought he had been through it all. Yet that was just the start. Before he could get his bearings, he found himself stuck in a time loop.  
  
Every Sunday, the same events, the same faces, the same city.  
Over thousands of cycles, he mastered all there was. Uncovered the secrets and deepest desires of the rich and powerful—  
Though, the fun of it soon faded. Turning into boredom, then madness. Then attempts to escape: all options tested—even death. *All failed.*

Until, one day, time finally moved.

After a night of fucking things up, Alexander wakes to something impossible: *Monday*.  
Now, he finds himself hunted by the mafia, with the daughter of a business tycoon in his bed, and nothing to his name. Yet for the first time in centuries, he feels alive.  
  
It doesn’t hurt that a game-like system that allows him to control his time reset has finally awakened.

Tropes: Harem (Only one male, multiple female.), dominant male lead, submissive (sexually) female leads, an OP MC on his way to the top.

"Just published my memoir — a true story about betrayal, injustice, and resilience","Hi everyone,

After a long and emotional journey, I finally published my memoir, *The Weight of Her Words*. It's the true story of how a personal conflict spiraled into something much bigger — involving false accusations, legal battles, and the way powerful people looked the other way when they shouldn't have.

This book was incredibly difficult to write. It’s raw, honest, and deeply personal. I chose to share my experience because I know I’m not the only one who’s been through something like this — and I believe stories like these need to be told, no matter how hard they are to tell.

If you’re someone who’s interested in memoirs that explore justice, betrayal, and resilience, I hope you’ll check it out. I’d also love to connect with other memoir writers here — feel free to share your work too!

It’s available now on Amazon in hardcover, paperback, and Kindle formats.

From Pages to Peaks by Rajeev Virmani- Self-help transformation spritual - Available on Amazon,"🌿 From Pages to Peaks
A Journey Beyond Words. A Search Beyond the Self.

What if the stories we write are only echoes of the truths we forget?
What if healing isn’t found in the silence of the Himalayas—but in the silence within?

From Pages to Peaks is not just a book—it is a pilgrimage of the soul. It follows the story of Arjun Kumar, a celebrated author at the peak of success, who collapses under the weight of his own hollowness. A mild heart stroke becomes a divine intervention, pulling him away from city lights and into the mysterious shadows of the Himalayas.

Guided by a nameless yogi, Arjun walks barefoot through ancient rituals, Vedic parables, symbolic flames, and eternal silences. He listens to wisdom that whispers, not shouts. Along the way, we meet seekers, sages, shadows of his past, and echoes of our own questions.

Through sacred symbols like the Four Bowls, parables of chariots and mountains, and the ultimate return to a chaotic city with a calm heart, From Pages to Peaks becomes a mirror—a book that doesn’t speak at you but walks with you.

Whether you're burned out by modern life or simply yearning to reconnect with something timeless, this is your invitation to pause, breathe, and listen to what your heart has been trying to tell you.

✨ Because some books are not read with the eyes—they are read with the soul.

The Wasps and the Dragonfly,"

This is a short horror novel that I wrote over the course of about a year and which was published last month. The blurb and the link are included below. Content warnings include child death and references to drug use. 



*Angela has an overactive imagination.*  
  
*Angela makes things up.*  
  
That's what everyone in Angela's working class town of West Cornelia says. Angela wishes this were true, but she knows there are real monsters. Yet neither she nor her neighbors know just how real a monster can become when fed by a child's fear—not until the strange summer when Angela inadvertently brings something terrible into being. Now the boogeyman is coming for the children of West Cornelia—unless Angela herself can summon the courage to face it.

Lekker Direct – Expat Humor / Cultural Misadventure – Available on Kindle Unlimited,"**Front Cover:**  
[https://imgur.com/a/zlWKmGs](https://imgur.com/a/zlWKmGs)

📘 **Lekker Direct: Surviving the Netherlands One Awkward Moment at a Time**  
📚 *Available on Kindle Unlimited*  
[https://www.amazon.com/dp/9916430608](https://www.amazon.com/dp/9916430608)

  
**I didn’t plan to write a book.** I’m Dutch. We don’t plan books — we plan birthdays, dentist visits, when to go for a beer and the exact moment the garbage goes out.  
But while teaching Dutch to expats in my own country, I kept hearing the same stories: birthday circles, mysterious supermarket races, and the occasional psychological damage caused by a surprise Sinterklaas poem.  
Eventually, I stopped laughing *with* them and started writing things down.

*Lekker Direct* is what happens when you mix Dutch bluntness, expat confusion, and an endless supply of bitterballen. It’s not a textbook. It’s not a travel guide. It’s more like group therapy — but with jokes and fewer trust falls.

**So, what’s it about?**  
A Greek couple arrives in the Netherlands with good intentions and a broken bike. Things go downhill (and occasionally uphill, depending on the wind).

You’ll meet:

* An Italian couple who dares to show up late to a social event 😱
* An American who flinches every time someone mentions poetry
* A Portuguese woman stalked by curtainless windows
* …and a narrator who may or may not be hiding behind all of them.

The stories are based on real experiences, filtered through lightly fictionalized characters, and told with as much empathy as sarcasm allows.

Whether you're an expat, a Dutch person with a sense of humor, or just someone who enjoys watching others try to survive in a society where people schedule fun six weeks in advance — this one’s for you.

**Tropes:**

* Fish out of water
* Found community
* Culture clash
* Humor based on real life
* Expat misadventures
* Satirical social commentary

**Trigger Warnings:**  
None

**And to fellow writers here:**  
I’m not trained. I didn’t take a course. I just started writing because these stories wouldn’t leave me alone (kind of like Dutch opinions). I imagine many of you know the feeling. This book blends cultural nonfiction with character-driven humor, and I’d genuinely love your feedback — even if it's just to say, “Why is there so much mustard in this?”

A book about demonic possession in the mountains of Alaska,"https://www.amazon.com/Friendly-Anthony-Ledger-ebook/dp/B0DHZFDXMK

Demonic possession is a messy business. It has been occurring since the beginning of recorded time. Only within the last hundred years or so, has religion begun to see it more as a sickness of the mind, than one of the soul. Prescribing pills instead of exorcisms has become the norm. It's better to be sedated, than burned at the stake. As a result, troves of people get Xanax instead of a holy cleansing.

Eli lives in the mountains of Alaska, with his girlfriend Kumi. Content with his slice of life and the peace that comes with living in the middle of nowhere. Until an evil entity begins to relentlessly pursue him. Unfortunately, Eli can't tell if something nefarious is after him, or if he's just losing his mind. Thanks to years of horror movies and scary books, the lines of reality and fiction are blurred, making his dilemma that much harder for him to solve.

That's what the scary things that wait for us in the dark want though, right? To not believe they're actually there. We're much easier to attack, when living in blissful ignorance of reality.",2,0,2025-06-21,anthonyledger,Adult - Horror,1.0

**Has a photo ever ruined your life?**

These days, it can happen to anyone. We live in a world where billions of photos are taken every day and loads of them end up online for anyone to see. Most are harmless. Some can have devastating effects and even wreak havoc on a person’s life. 

Meet Brian Weathers, an anonymous writer whose books are quite popular. He could be famous if he wanted, but fame is something he’s always avoided at all costs. All he wants is a quiet, private life where no one ever recognises him.

However, he’s well aware of the staggering power a photo can have thanks to social media and the internet. He knows just a single photo can turn someone who’s little known into someone famous. To protect himself against this, he publishes under a pen name and has only told close friends and family about his writing. He’s never had the courage to step into the spotlight.

So what’s going to happen when a photo threatens to reveal his identity and shatter his privacy? Is a crisis looming for him? Will he have a meltdown?

If you’re after a modern-day *The Catcher in the Rye*, you’ll enjoy *No Going Back*.

Tropes: Paranoia, anxiety, being outed, doesn't want fame, privacy, anonymity, celebrity.

"I lost 40 kg, fixed my insulin and liver, and wrote a book about how I did it","Over the course of about 6–8 months, I lost 40 kilograms (about 88 pounds), reversed my insulin resistance, and significantly improved my liver health — without medications. My journey was built on a foundation of intermittent fasting, healthy keto-inspired nutrition, and lots of trial and error.

I documented everything: the mistakes, the breakthroughs, what helped, what didn’t — and turned it into a book to help others on a similar path.

The book is written in a friendly and clear style, with no fluff, spam, or unrealistic claims. It’s not just theory — it’s a detailed, real-world case study backed by research and personal data.

🟢 **Who it’s for**:  
People dealing with insulin resistance, stubborn fat (especially around the belly), fatty liver, low energy, or weight that won't budge — even if they’re working out.

🟢 **Why it’s different**:

* Practical daily routines you can apply
* Clear signs of metabolic problems to watch for
* How I used fasting windows and cruciferous vegetables to reset my health
* What finally *clicked* after years of failures

I walked these paths for twenty years - I lost weight and gained weight. As a result, I studied the works of Nobel laureates and world-famous professors and applied them to myself.

I write under the name Biohacker Daimonix and here is my first book - An Easy Way to Regain Health and Lose Weight: The Time Machine.

***Thick fur, hungry fangs and sharpened claws. On Tamuz, it’s hunt-or-be-hunted, and Asher is a vegetarian…***

Asher has spent his life running from responsibility. But when tragedy strikes and the Rabbethi kingdom is threatened by a bloodthirsty horde, he discovers there’s nowhere left to run. With his people fractured and their survival uncertain, Asher must become the one thing he has always feared – king.

His only hope to re-unite the kingdom lies in an ancient weapon lost to time, said to grant its wielder a fragment of divinity. Accompanied by Cara, a cunning and skilled agent of the Vulpen Queendom, Asher must travel to distant lands, put his trust in foreign leaders and enter the domain of ancient enemies. Though conflicting loyalties and natural instincts set them at odds, the two must work together to outpace a more primal and ravenous force than war itself.

However, a high priestess has her own designs for the weapon – and Asher’s blood. If she succeeds, an even darker force will rise, threatening to consume all of Tamuz. Asher soon learns that claiming the artefact is only the beginning, and the price of failure could doom not only his people but all of Tamuz.

With the crown heavy upon his head and the fate of the world in his paws, Asher must choose: become the leader his people need or let the world be swallowed in blood and shadow.

I wrote a book. It will be published this summer by Holand Press. A true story based on historical research. Here is the preface.,"Preface to Tegart’s War: A Story of Empire, Rebellion, and Terror. A Biographical Novel by Stuart Logie

Charles Tegart became a colonial policeman in India in the first days of the twentieth century, a time when India was the largest colony in history’s largest empire in the heyday of Imperialism.

Colonial India was in transition to new matrixes of power, knowledge, law, and technology that were beginning to shape the modern era. It became a laboratory for statistics-based modes of knowledge production that gave the colony the modern governmental techniques of social, political and economic management. And it provided inspiration, precedents, and opportunities for the personnel in colonial administration of India and elsewhere in the empire.

At the same time, a popular wave of anti-colonialism challenged the sovereign rule of the British. After a series of violent attacks, Charles Tegart and the police found themselves at war against the Other. Holding fast to the Imperial world view, he saw the Other as the primitive non-believer from the East who resorted to extreme violence against a civilizing force that had no choice but to respond in kind.

It was a just war. Terrorism was evil and indiscriminate, barbaric in its world view, culture, and religion, and, most importantly, it posed a security threat to modern liberal governments. In such a state of emergency was born the logic of empire: the right to use extrajudicial violence in a war on the Other. It was us against them. You are for us or against us. When U.S. President George Bush declared a “global war on terrorism” after 9/11, he used exactly the same logic of empire.

Tegart discovered that the rule of law and a colonial state of emergency had an intimate and anxious relationship that he could exploit to further his career. A liberal government could not look at terrorism and see a mere “political” offence: It was too beyond the pale for that. Terrorism was a crime against the King – a most heinous crime – but it was apolitical and had to be criminalized as such. The government created a political police armed with a raft of repressive political laws but then pretended it was something else entirely, a temporary “special branch” to deal with “states of exception” to the rule of law. The values of liberal democracy were safe and Tegart wanted to be the one to keep it that way.

Tegart quickly learnt how to navigate this new geography of political policing, and in the process he became an expert in counterterrorism for the empire. He lobbied for a permanent criminal framework of counterterrorism laws and techniques, which gave the first contours to this new criminal behavior. Terrorism was an extraordinary crime that had extraordinary consequences for the criminal: a divestiture of citizenship with no protection under liberal law, a liminal space reserved for exceptionally dangerous criminals.

As such, it needed a special kind of policeman. Tegart devoted a career to recruiting and training policemen for the special work of cornering violent terrorists in the middle of the night in their places of hiding, torturing and interrogating them, and keeping them in jail as long as they posed a threat to state security. The harder they were to find and convict, the more punitive the police violence would become. The empire increasingly came to depend on Tegart’s expertise in the matter.

Tegart’s war was in fact the precursor to the global war on terrorism. His story shows how a colonial empire shaped the justification for the new security paradigm of the modern liberal state we know today.

And he was quite a character as well. ",1,0,2025-06-20,Outrageous_Cut_6179,Adult - Historical Fiction,0.67
"Thank You All – I Love Writing, and I Love What I Write","Hi everyone,

Just wanted to share a big milestone in my self-publishing journey and say thank you to everyone who’s shown interest in my book.

I’m a Brazilian author, and I wrote my fantasy series originally in Portuguese. For a long time, I tried translating it myself into English, but honestly, it was incredibly hard. I could only capture the basic meaning of what I’d written not the full depth or tone.

But recently, thanks to a few readers and two American friends of mine (who served as missionaries with me), I was finally able to hire a translator and editor to fully adapt the story into proper English. The difference has been amazing. For the first time, I feel like the real version of my world the one I imagined is finally on the page.

I’ll be sharing a few chapters across different writing communities so others can see the before-and-after difference. It’s been a huge learning curve I’m still terrible at marketing, editing, and everything outside the actual writing. But I love writing, and I love what I write.


If you’ve gone through anything similar like trying to self-translate or publish in another language I’d love to hear about your experience too. Thanks again to everyone who’s encouraged me to keep going!


***Chapter 18 - Agonies and Losses***

 The Beginning of the Fall

The flames licked the trees like serpents born from hell’s deepest furnaces. What had once been sacred ground beneath ancient boughs was now a field of broken bones and shattered dreams, where the living stepped over the dead without ceremony and survival meant abandoning every civilized notion about honor in warfare. The First Company was trapped in a living nightmare that exceeded every horror their months of preparation had been designed to address.

Groon charged through the chaos like a beast of war whose fury had been refined through decades of combat into something approaching divine wrath. His Sunstone blade spun through enemy ranks like a sentence of death passed on all who dared stand before him in this harvest of destruction. The weapon blazed with inner fire, cutting through flesh and bone as if they were parchment. One strike removed an orc’s head so cleanly the creature took three steps before realizing it was dead. Another split a lesser ogre from shoulder to hip, releasing a torrent of black blood that steamed in the cold air.

With every step forward, he left ruin behind—severed limbs that twitched with fading life, crushed skulls that leaked gray matter onto soil transformed from earth to mud by the systematic application of violence. The commander had moved beyond mortal limitations into something that balanced perfectly between heroism and monstrosity.

But their numbers were greater than the sky itself, vast as eternity and apparently inexhaustible despite carnage that should have broken any normal force’s morale. For every enemy that fell to elvish steel or human courage, two more seemed to emerge from the shadows, their eyes burning with fanatic determination that spoke of influences beyond simple tribal warfare.

“HE’S STILL STANDING!” an archer cried from somewhere in the melee, his voice carrying both amazement and desperate hope as he pointed toward their commander whose survival had become the beating heart of their resistance against overwhelming odds. The words cut through the sounds of battle like a prayer to gods who might still be listening despite mounting evidence that divine favor had abandoned this blood-soaked ground.

Groon roared in response, his voice carrying primal fury as he drove his blade deep into the muscled leg of Zumgar, the Jawbreaker. The massive ogre whose reputation had been earned by crushing human skulls between his teeth tried to retaliate with movements that would have pulverized stone, but Groon twisted away with fluid grace and lopped off the monster’s head with a perfect arc that sent the spine whipping through smoky air like a dying serpent.

The headless body collapsed forward with earth-shaking impact, its weight sufficient to crack ancient roots and send tremors through ground that had been consecrated by violence rather than peaceful ritual. Black blood pooled beneath the corpse in quantities that seemed to exceed what any single creature should have contained.

 The Price of Love

Luucner fought with desperate intensity just meters away, twin flaming daggers leaving trails of fire through air thick with smoke and the metallic scent of spilled blood. His movements carried the fluid precision of someone who had entered the battle-trance that experienced warriors cultivated when ordinary reflexes proved inadequate for processing threats that emerged from multiple directions without warning. His eyes had taken on the glazed appearance of someone deep in combat meditation, where time slowed and every enemy movement became predictable.

Elara maintained position close to his flank despite wounds that would have sent lesser fighters retreating toward medical attention. A gash across her shoulder leaked crimson down her arm, but she fought through the pain with grim determination. Her presence served as both tactical support and emotional anchor during chaos that threatened to overwhelm rational thought with primal terror.

Then disaster struck with the sudden brutality that marked moments when fortune shifted decisively against those who had been fighting with skill and courage but could not overcome the fundamental mathematics of being vastly outnumbered. Lo’mash, the Stone-Toothed, whose massive frame spoke of enhancement beyond normal flesh and bone, charged directly at Luucner with speed that belied his enormous size.

The ogre’s approach generated sound like approaching thunder, his feet striking ground with enough force to crack stone while his roar carried notes designed to paralyze prey through sheer acoustic assault that bypassed conscious thought to trigger instinctive responses.

“WATCH OUT!” Elara screamed, her voice cutting through the chaos as recognition of trajectory and lethal potential drove her into action that prioritized Luucner’s survival over her own safety. Without hesitation that might have allowed rational calculation of odds or consideration of alternatives, she launched herself directly into the path of destruction.

The impact struck with force that seemed to slow time itself around the point of contact. Her right arm snapped with sounds that spoke of compound fractures and damage that would require months of careful healing under optimal conditions. The sickening crack echoed across the battlefield like a gunshot. The ogre’s massive club continued its devastating arc to strike her left leg with crushing force that reduced bone to fragments beneath flesh that could no longer support normal weight.

The injury produced sounds that experienced warriors learned to recognize as indicators of damage that exceeded what conventional medical treatment could address. She was hurled backward through air thick with smoke and ash, her trajectory describing a perfect arc that terminated when her body struck an ancient root with impact sufficient to drive consciousness from her mind.

She collapsed in a spreading pool of blood whose bright color seemed to mock every assumption about the possibility of protecting those who mattered most when forces beyond individual control determined outcomes through applications of violence that exceeded what personal skill could adequately counter.

“ELARA!” Luucner’s scream tore from his throat with raw agony that cut through his battle-trance like a blade through silk, restoring emotional awareness at precisely the moment when tactical focus would have been most crucial for his own survival. The sound carried across the battlefield with intensity that seemed to pause the fighting momentarily, as if even hardened warriors recognized the particular quality of anguish that marked someone witnessing the destruction of everything that gave their survival meaning.

Then fury took him with completeness that transformed his entire being into something that transcended normal limitations and entered territory where emotion became indistinguishable from supernatural force. His green eyes blazed red as energy coursed through his body, enhancing speed and strength while burning away everything that might have restrained his response to threats that had become personal rather than merely tactical.

He launched himself at Lo’mash with velocity that seemed to compress distance and time into a single moment of contact that would determine whether rage enhanced by supernatural heritage could overcome size and experience through pure intensity of purpose. Howling with fury that contained grief transformed into weapon-grade hatred, he tore into the beast’s hide with daggers that moved faster than sight could follow.

Nothing had ever struck the massive ogre with the concentrated fury that Luucner now brought to bear against flesh that had seemed impervious to normal weapons. Lo’mash had survived countless battles through superior strength and tactical intelligence, but this assault operated according to principles that transcended normal combat to enter territory where emotion and supernatural enhancement created possibilities that no amount of experience could prepare someone to defend against.

Each strike carried not just physical force but emotional intensity that had been distilled from love and loss into something that challenged the boundaries of what mortal beings could channel through determination alone. Luucner moved with speed that seemed to violate natural law, darting around the massive ogre in patterns that left Lo’mash disoriented and unable to track movements that came from multiple directions simultaneously.

His consciousness had contracted to a single point of absolute focus—the systematic destruction of this creature whose existence had become an affront to everything he believed about protecting those who couldn’t protect themselves. He was a predator who had found his prey, and nothing else in the world mattered except the kill.

The ogre swung its club in wide arcs that would have pulverized stone, but Luucner’s attention remained locked on his target with the kind of focus that transformed complex tactical calculations into instinctive responses that operated faster than conscious thought. He stabbed repeatedly with mechanical precision, his blades finding spaces between ribs and penetrating to vital organs with supernatural accuracy.

Each wound released steam and light as the magical properties of his weapons interacted with otherworldly energies that governed Lo’mash’s enhanced physiology, creating reactions that spoke of forces beyond normal understanding of how steel affected living tissue. The scent of burning flesh and vaporized blood filled the air around them.

Spinning behind the massive creature with grace that utilized every advantage his smaller size and elvish heritage provided, he targeted the tendons and ligaments that supported the enormous weight. His strikes severed structural elements with surgical precision, creating injuries that ensured size and strength became liabilities rather than advantages once essential supports had been compromised.

The tendons shredded and seared under assault that combined physical cutting with magical properties that cauterized wounds while inflicting damage. Lo’mash fell to his knees as his legs could no longer support his massive frame, the impact creating tremors that spoke of density and mass that exceeded normal biological parameters.

Luucner leaped onto the ogre’s broad back with fluid motion that demonstrated perfect timing and spatial awareness, positioning himself for the killing blow that would end this particular threat while providing psychological satisfaction that came from completing a task whose importance transcended tactical considerations. He drove both daggers through the back of the skull with force sufficient to penetrate bone and brain tissue until the points emerged through the creature’s face, ensuring immediate death while providing visual confirmation that justice had been served.

Then his body collapsed as the supernatural energy that had sustained him through impossible combat drained away, leaving him vulnerable and exhausted. He was soaked in black blood whose properties seemed to resist normal removal, while his muscles trembled with the aftermath of exertion that had burned through reserves and temporarily overridden limitations that normally governed what individuals could accomplish.

Despite physical exhaustion that threatened unconsciousness, his thoughts remained focused on Elara whose condition had become his primary concern now that immediate threats had been neutralized. “Tetus… Tetus…” he called the name of the healer whose reputation for preserving life under impossible circumstances had made him invaluable during military operations that generated casualties requiring immediate medical intervention.

 The Long Walk to Hell

He ran toward her position with movements that spoke of desperation rather than tactical awareness, his attention focused entirely on reaching someone whose survival had become more important than strategic considerations. Past mutilated corpses whose identities had been erased by violence, past burning equipment whose destruction marked the systematic breakdown of everything they had relied upon, past sounds that would haunt his dreams for whatever remained of his life.

Her red hair was matted with blood whose bright color seemed obscene against the dark earth. She breathed faintly, unconscious but alive in ways that suggested internal systems continued to function despite external damage that would have killed others whose constitution lacked the peculiar resilience that seemed to characterize individuals whose lives had been shaped by exposure to supernatural forces.

He lifted her with movements that combined desperate care with recognition that time constraints did not permit the gentle handling her injuries ideally required. Her weight seemed both substantial and fragile, as if trauma had somehow altered the relationship between consciousness and flesh in ways conventional understanding could not explain.

Weaving through chaos that continued around them, he navigated by instinct rather than conscious planning, his vision tunneled to encompass only the objective of reaching medical assistance that could address injuries requiring intervention beyond what normal battlefield treatment could provide.

He found Tetus kneeling among wounded soldiers whose injuries represented the systematic breakdown of everything medical training had prepared them to handle. The healer’s hands moved with practiced efficiency despite conditions that challenged every assumption about maintaining proper patient care under circumstances where survival took priority over optimal treatment protocols.

“SHE NEEDS YOU! NOW!” Luucner’s voice carried desperation and authority in equal measure, reflecting both personal emotional investment and understanding that immediate intervention might determine whether expertise could overcome damage that had pushed her physical systems beyond normal recovery parameters.

Tetus responded without hesitation or questions about circumstances that had led to these particular injuries. His assessment was quick but thorough, hands moving over wounds that spoke of impact trauma that had challenged every system governing consciousness and physical integrity. He laid Elara between damp cloths and began working on her shattered limbs with hands that trembled from exhaustion but remained steady where it mattered.

“She’ll live,” he said with professional confidence that balanced realistic evaluation of damage against faith in his own abilities and access to treatments that transcended conventional medicine. “But you need to go back, boy. They still need you.”

Luucner gripped her hand one final time, feeling warmth that spoke of life that refused to surrender despite trauma that had tested every essential function. The contact provided reassurance that his desperate efforts had not been wasted, while also serving as a promise that their connection would survive whatever challenges lay ahead.

Then he stood and returned to witness the systematic collapse of everything they had built and trained for throughout months of preparation that had proven inadequate for addressing threats whose capabilities exceeded every assumption about what enemies could accomplish through coordination and planning.

The Fall of Heroes

When he returned to the main battlefield, what he saw confirmed his worst fears about the tactical situation and the likelihood that individual heroics could overcome systematic disadvantages. The battlefield was strewn with corpses whose identities had been erased by violence that reduced individuals to anonymous statistics. The forest choked on black smoke that seemed to resist natural dispersal, creating an atmosphere that challenged both vision and breathing.

And Groon still fought with determination that had carried him through decades of combat, but now he was surrounded by enemies whose numbers seemed to increase despite the carnage he had inflicted through sustained effort that should have broken any normal force’s morale. His survival had become both inspiration and tragedy—proof that individual excellence could persist even under circumstances that made broader success impossible.

Wounds had accumulated despite his supernatural resilience and tactical skill. A deep gash in his thigh affected his mobility, while his shattered shoulder armor exposed vulnerability that enemies could exploit through coordinated attacks. Blood loss and accumulated trauma were affecting his coordination despite enhancement that had allowed him to continue fighting when normal human limitations would have rendered him unconscious.

But he still gripped his Sunstone sword with both hands, the weapon’s supernatural properties providing enhanced capability that had allowed continued combat when normal equipment would have proven inadequate. His chest heaved like a cornered beast whose survival depended on resources that went beyond normal biological capabilities.

He had slain dozens of enemies whose individual capabilities should have made such systematic destruction impossible for any single warrior, yet their numbers continued to increase as if his success had served as a signal for reinforcements whose coordination suggested preparation and strategic planning that conventional intelligence had failed to detect.

Mowee, the ogre leader whose massive frame spoke of enhancement that transcended normal biological development, charged with movements that combined tactical intelligence and personal fury refined through years of successful combat. Hatred burned in his eyes with intensity that seemed to generate its own illumination, reflecting emotions that had been distilled through countless battles into supernatural force that enhanced his already formidable physical capabilities.

The beast’s remaining arm rose with mechanical precision, muscles bulging with power that had been augmented beyond normal parameters through processes that conventional understanding could not explain. The strike he prepared would have been sufficient to crush stone, while the coordination and timing spoke of experience refined through countless victories.

“ELDORIA!” Groon roared as he lifted his blade high in a gesture that embodied everything he had dedicated his life to protecting through military service that had shaped his understanding of duty and honor in ways that transcended personal interest.

As Mowee’s devastating blow descended with force sufficient to pulverize granite, Groon spun aside with timing so precise it seemed to compress causality into a single instant where success and failure balanced on impossibility’s edge. He drove his Sunstone sword into the ogre’s remaining leg with force that carried the accumulated weight of his entire career and desperate knowledge that failure would result in consequences extending far beyond his personal death.

The blade cut deep into enhanced bone, its supernatural properties interacting with otherworldly energies to create effects that transcended normal understanding of how weapons affected living tissue. Mowee stumbled and howled with pain that seemed to come from depths exceeding normal anatomy, spitting black blood whose properties challenged assumptions about biological processes.

But he did not fall despite damage that should have rendered continued combat impossible. With his remaining hand gripping an axe whose weight and balance spoke of craftsmanship that exceeded normal technological capabilities, he maintained his footing through constitution that defied every assumption about what enhancement could accomplish within physical reality’s constraints.

The battle of titans continued with intensity that seemed to warp the very fabric of reality around them, as if their conflict had transcended normal military engagement to become something that challenged the fundamental order of the world itself.

Meanwhile, Luucner and Ziif had managed to bring down Grudhok through coordinated action, but they were bloodied and worn by sustained combat that had tested every aspect of their training and determination.

“WE HAVE TO HELP GROON!” Ziif shouted while gasping for breath that smoke and exertion had made difficult.

“HE’S STILL ON HIS FEET!” Luucner replied with recognition that their commander’s survival represented more than tactical advantage—it embodied the symbolic heart of their resistance.

But the battlefield had become chaos incarnate, a living manifestation of destruction that challenged every assumption about organized warfare. Fire roared among the ancient trees with supernatural intensity. Orcs shrieked with victory that spoke of systematic destruction of everything their enemies had built. The few elves and humans who remained either fought blindly through shock or collapsed in despair that came from witnessing the impossible made real.

At the center of the clearing, Groon and Mowee circled each other like primal beasts whose conflict had stripped away everything civilized to reveal the fundamental nature of violence that lay beneath all pretense of honor and nobility. Two forces that had transcended normal limitations through different paths now faced each other in combat that would determine not just tactical outcomes but symbolic meaning for everyone who survived to carry the memory forward.

The End of Everything

The battlefield had become a canvas painted in ash, blood, and dismembered corpses whose stories had been reduced to anonymous components of larger calculations. Fire raged around them as if hell itself had opened to witness the last stand of a hero whose legend would be written in defeat rather than triumph.

Groon and Mowee stood at the heart of the clearing, surrounded by a wall of corpses that marked the extent of destruction they had wrought in their passage toward this final moment. The elven warrior, stripped of most armor by accumulated damage, breathed heavily through wounds that should have killed him hours ago. His bare chest was marked by gashes and burns that spoke of proximity to forces beyond normal understanding.

The ogre, missing an arm but still formidable, held his massive axe with the kind of grip that suggested absolute confidence in the outcome despite his own injuries. His eyes blazed with ancestral fury that had been refined through generations of conflict into something approaching supernatural hatred for everything the elf represented.

“You will fall,” Mowee growled, blood dripping from his mouth to pool at his feet. “All of you will fall like wheat before the scythe.”

Groon gave no answer because there were no words left that could bridge the gap between what they represented. His emerald eyes remained fixed on his opponent with the kind of focus that came from accepting that this moment would define everything that followed, regardless of who survived to see morning.

There was only war now, stripped of politics and strategy and all the comfortable lies that civilized beings told themselves about the nature of violence and the possibility of honor in killing.

He charged with one final burst of strength that drew upon reserves he had been saving for exactly this moment when everything would be decided through single combat that would determine the fate of more than just two individuals. His Sunstone sword spun through the air like a falling comet, slashing into Mowee’s abdomen with devastating force that made the surrounding trees groan in sympathetic resonance.

The cut nearly split the ogre open from side to side, releasing torrents of black blood that steamed against the cold air while carrying with it energies that spoke of forces beyond normal biological processes. But Mowee, though grievously wounded, managed to remain upright through constitution that exceeded every assumption about what enhancement could accomplish within the constraints of physical reality.

With a roar that seemed to shake the forest’s very foundations, the ogre raised his axe and swung it in a brutal diagonal arc that carried all his remaining strength and fury distilled into a single strike that would end this prolonged conflict through application of enhanced power that had been proven effective against countless previous opponents.

The blade struck Groon’s side with impact that cracked ribs and split flesh and bone, creating wounds that released crimson spray in patterns that would have been beautiful under different circumstances. Blood burst from the wound like a crimson geyser, painting the scorched ground in abstract patterns that spoke of mortality made manifest.

Mowee surged forward despite his own grievous injuries, using his superior mass and remaining strength to kick Groon’s sword aside before the elf could recover his footing or mount effective defense against follow-up attacks that would certainly prove fatal. Placing one massive foot on the warrior’s chest to prevent escape or resistance, he raised his axe for the killing blow that would end this particular threat while serving as demonstration of superiority that would demoralize any remaining opposition.

The axe descended with finality that admitted no possibility of intervention or miraculous rescue. Groon’s head separated from his body with a sound that seemed to echo through dimensions beyond normal acoustics, rolling across scorched ground until it came to rest against roots that had been watered with heroes’ blood.

The champion of Eldoria had fallen—not in glory that poets would celebrate, but in horror that survivors would remember with the kind of trauma that changed people in fundamental ways that could never be reversed or forgotten.

A savage roar tore from Mowee’s throat as he raised the bloodied axe toward sky that seemed to absorb his words and reflect them back as promise of consequences that would extend far beyond this immediate battlefield.

“THIS IS THE END OF ELDORIA’S SONS!” he bellowed with voice that carried across the clearing like physical force, his victory earned through superior preparation and tactical intelligence rather than simple brutality.

Silence swept across the combat zone like a tide of despair that left survivors contemplating the magnitude of what they had witnessed and its implications for their own survival in a world where heroes could be defeated and symbols could be destroyed through application of force that transcended normal understanding of what was possible.

Then came the scream that shattered the quiet with intensity that seemed to physically manifest grief and rage that had been compressed beyond human tolerance for emotional pain.

“NOOOOOOOOOOO!” Luucner’s voice challenged gods and fate and every force that had conspired to create circumstances where such losses became inevitable despite everything they had sacrificed to prevent exactly this outcome.

Ziif stood frozen with an expression that suggested disbelief so complete it approached catatonia, as if his mind had simply refused to process information that challenged every assumption about what was possible when skill and courage worked together against enemies whose capabilities seemed limited by conventional understanding.

Mowee, maimed and soaked in blood but victorious, dropped his axe beside Groon’s lifeless body with a gesture that spoke of contempt for opponents whose abilities had proven inadequate despite reputation and preparation that should have rendered them formidable adversaries. He picked up the severed head and, in a display of cruelty that transcended normal concepts of victory celebration, bit into dead flesh with teeth that had been designed for exactly this purpose.

He tore pieces from Groon’s face and chewed them with obvious relish before spitting fragments onto ground that had been consecrated by violence rather than peaceful ritual. Then, lifting the head high like a trophy that represented not just tactical victory but symbolic destruction of everything Eldoria claimed to represent in terms of civilization and moral authority, he screamed toward heaven with voice that carried promise of consequences extending far beyond immediate battlefield.

“LET FEAR FOLLOW YOU TO YOUR GRAVES!”

 The Broken Company

The First Company shattered like glass struck by a hammer. Orcs howled with ecstasy that came from witnessing the destruction of symbols they had been taught to hate and fear throughout their brief, brutal lives. Ogres pounded weapons against their chests in rhythm that spoke of tribal celebration whose roots went back to times when such victories had been common rather than exceptional achievements requiring careful planning and supernatural enhancement to accomplish.

Elves staggered backward with expressions that suggested psychological trauma that would require years to heal even under optimal conditions with access to counselors who understood how minds processed experiences that exceeded normal parameters for what conscious beings could witness and retain sanity. Humans fled with empty stares that spoke of shock so complete it had temporarily severed connections between observation and emotional response that normally allowed individuals to process information and formulate appropriate reactions.

Luucner clenched his fists until knuckles showed white beneath skin that had been stained with the blood of monsters and heroes without discrimination between their moral worth or tactical importance. Ziif grabbed his arm with grip that spoke of understanding that grief and rage might drive actions that would accomplish nothing except ensuring additional casualties among survivors whose lives had suddenly become precious beyond normal calculation.

“Not now… not here,” Ziif said with voice that carried professional assessment and personal concern in equal measure. His mercenary background had taught him about tactical withdrawal and strategic necessity that sometimes required abandoning positions and objectives that could not be held without sacrificing resources that would be needed for future operations whose success might depend on preserving experienced personnel.

“He died for us,” Luucner whispered with recognition that Groon’s sacrifice had purchased time and opportunity that survivors could use to escape destruction that would otherwise have been complete and systematic rather than partial defeat that left possibilities for revenge and eventual justice.

“We must carry this home,” Ziif replied with understanding that their primary obligation now was to survive long enough to deliver intelligence about enemy capabilities and tactical approaches that could inform future planning for operations designed to address threats that clearly exceeded what preliminary assessments had suggested was possible.

“Come on,” he continued with urgency that came from recognizing that emotional processing would have to wait until they reached safety that could only be achieved through immediate movement away from a battlefield that had become a monument to the inadequacy of their preparation. “There are still survivors.”

The Long Walk Home

Further back among trees whose shadows provided concealment from enemies who might be pursuing stragglers, Tetus guarded wounded soldiers whose injuries represented the systematic breakdown of everything their medical training had prepared them to handle through conventional treatment protocols. When Luucner and Ziif reached his position, their expressions communicated information about battlefield conditions that made continued resistance impossible and immediate withdrawal necessary for preserving lives that could still be saved.



Someone had to carry this defeat back to Eldoria, bearing witness to destruction that challenged every comfortable assumption about their civilization’s military superiority and strategic position relative to enemies whose capabilities clearly exceeded what conventional intelligence gathering had been able to detect or assess through methods that relied on cultural prejudices rather than objective analysis of actual threats.

The forest sky was blackened not by natural nightfall but by ash that fell like snow from fires that had consumed more than trees and equipment to encompass hopes and assumptions and comfortable beliefs about what was possible when civilization confronted forces that operated beyond normal understanding of primitive limitations and strategic constraints.

The First Company dissolved into component elements that bore little resemblance to the disciplined military formation that had entered the forest with confidence earned through months of intensive training and tactical preparation that had proven adequate for addressing conventional threats but insufficient for enemies whose capabilities included supernatural enhancement and strategic intelligence that exceeded every assumption.

The living—those few who remained capable of independent movement despite wounds and trauma that marked them as casualties whose survival represented luck rather than skill or tactical superiority—staggered through shadows like refugees from catastrophe that had destroyed not just their military effectiveness but fundamental assumptions about their own capabilities and strategic position relative to enemies whose preparation and coordination suggested resources and expertise that conventional analysis had failed to detect.

Blood soaked their bodies while smoke clouded their eyes, creating conditions that challenged basic sensory functions necessary for navigation and threat detection during withdrawal that would test every aspect of their remaining strength and determination. Death walked behind them with patience that spoke of confidence about eventual outcomes that would reduce survivors to statistics in calculations that measured success according to numbers rather than individual stories and personal sacrifices that each loss represented.

Luucner led the way with face streaked by soot and tears that carved clean channels through grime that spoke of proximity to fires and violence that had transformed familiar forest into alien landscape where normal rules no longer applied and survival depended on adaptation rather than application of established procedures. His daggers remained ready despite exhaustion that threatened to overwhelm physical systems that had been pushed beyond sustainable limits through emotional intensity and supernatural enhancement.

His eyes were downcast, hands clenched in fists that spoke of rage that had been temporarily suppressed but never extinguished. Groon’s head had been left behind—not by choice but by impossibility, by horror, by despair that came from recognizing that some defeats were so complete they stripped away everything except the bare necessity of survival and the obligation to carry testimony of what had been lost.

Ziif walked beside him in silence that spoke of professional assessment and personal grief that would require processing when circumstances allowed time for emotional responses that immediate survival could not accommodate. His pistols were empty, their violet glow dimmed to levels that suggested energy depletion requiring recharge procedures that could only be accomplished under controlled conditions with access to resources that might not be available during withdrawal through hostile territory where pursuit remained possible.

Tetus led the wounded soldiers whose injuries represented a spectrum of trauma that challenged medical expertise earned through years of battlefield experience with casualties whose conditions remained within parameters that conventional treatment could address through techniques that had been proven effective under similar circumstances. Elara, unconscious and bound with improvised bandages that spoke of field medicine applied under conditions that allowed no time for optimal care, was carried on a stretcher constructed from available materials by soldiers whose own wounds made such service painful but necessary for preserving life that represented connection to purposes that transcended immediate survival.

Only eighty-five remained from a force that had numbered in the thousands when they entered the forest with confidence that had been earned through reputation and preparation that seemed adequate for addressing the challenges they expected to encounter. The mathematics of loss spoke of systematic destruction that exceeded normal battlefield casualties to encompass virtual annihilation of military capability that had been assembled through months of intensive training and resource allocation designed to create a force capable of accomplishing objectives that now seemed impossible to achieve.

“We’ll take the western pass,” Luucner said with voice that carried exhaustion and determination in equal measure, his tactical assessment reflecting understanding that survival depended on choosing routes that minimized contact with enemy forces while providing access to medical facilities that could treat casualties whose conditions required immediate intervention by experts whose training transcended what field conditions could provide.

“Skirt the forest and reach the river road. If we move fast, we can reach Eldoria in two days,” Ziif replied with professional calculation that balanced available information about terrain and tactical situation against realistic assessment of their own capabilities and limitations given current circumstances and resource constraints that would influence every decision about route selection and movement speed.

Book Summary - The Foundation: A Blueprint for Becoming an Authentically Attractive Man by Michael Owen,"

This is a high level summary of my book I released last year. It is a men’s dating advice and self improvement book, in the same vein as Models by Mark Manson.


Part 1 - Developing Inner Game: Independence, Charisma, Resilience and Growth

Independence 

Independence is the essential element of a powerful, dynamic masculinity. This sense of independence is driven by purpose. Purpose is the one thing that defines you, which you feel incomplete without. Purpose doesn’t include advancing in your career or romantic relationships.

Another key component of independence is embracing the concept that you are on your own. Only you truly understand your desires and ambitions. Friends and family don’t always want what’s best for you; even if they do, they may have misguided thoughts about what YOU want.

Charisma

Charisma isn’t as much about how people feel about you, but rather how you make them feel about themselves. From the Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane, the elements of charisma are: Power, Presence, and Warmth.

Some general points on charisma:

- Your thoughts define you
- Learn to be an engaged, present listener
- Become a student of non-verbal communication and body language 

Resilience and Growth 

Gratitude is the cornerstone of resilience. Despite any problem you have, understand relative suffering, that there are those out there who are truly suffering. 

The false threshold- the belief that life will be easy once you reach a certain milestone. This is a false belief. There will always be difficulty, and your development as person never ends.

Visualization and self-talk are crucial components of growth. Your mind has difficulty distinguishing reality from your inner dialogue and imagination. If your inner  narrative is consistently negative, it WILL be your reality.

Part 2- Understanding Attraction 

1. Keep it simple. There isn’t some mystery to being fundamentally attractive. 90% is maintaining your health, fitness, grooming, having decent social skills, and having your life together

2. Self limiting beliefs. Self limiting beliefs that hold men back:

- Leagues
- Alpha Male bullshit
- The One- there’s “one” person out there

3. High value characteristics:

- Having respectful, clearly defined boundaries 
- Being able to handle rejection gracefully 
- Being truly busy and not always available 
- Being what you want to attract and more

4. The world is truly abundant in terms of dating opportunities. There are 7 billion people on the planet. Just purely by the numbers, even if .01 of the women on earth found you attractive, you still wouldn’t have the time or resources to date them all

Tips for cold approach:

- Be outcome dependent, think of it as an adventure

- Smile 

- Don’t be timid with your voice 

- Don’t drag the conversation along

Tips for online dating:

- Online dating is nothing more than a tool and fun social experiment, don’t get all in your feelings about it 

- EVERYONE gets ghosted, flaked, used for attention, NOT just you

- Pictures are the most important element. Only use high-resolution photos, limit selfies. Be somewhat irreverent and polarizing in your profile 

Exercises:

The final chapter is more than 10 exercises which out the concepts into practice.

Conclusion:

You have to undergo high levels of discomfort , work and sacrifice. Most modern men want things like a beautiful girlfriend but refuse to get outside of their comfort zone and put in the work.

Don’t forget to be patient with yourself and HAVE FUN. By simply getting out of your head a little, things will naturally fall into place. It’s incredibly important that we lift each other up as men and celebrate each other’s victories.",0,0,2025-06-19,MO_drps_knwldg,Non-Fiction,0.29

"My novel ""Athens, or, The Athenians"", just self-published on Amazon","**THE DAWN OF DEMOCRACY.**  
**THE CHILDHOOD OF SOKRATES.**

In the golden age of **Athens**, as democracy takes its first uncertain steps, a remarkable cast of characters shapes the future of human thought, living their everyday lives.

Young Perikles, scion of a noble family, dreams of a city ruled by wisdom rather than wealth, while the hero Themistokles, who once saved Greece from Persian invasion, finds his power and influence tested by changing times. In the streets below the Acropolis, a curious boy named Sokrates begins asking questions that will resonate through centuries, while young Euripides struggles to find his voice as a playwright in the shadow of theatrical giants Aischylos and Sophokles.

Beyond Athens' walls, Sparta watches its rival's rise with growing unease. Within the warrior state's palace, the formidable queen-mother Gorgo maneuvers to maintain Spartan traditions against forces that threaten to tear her society apart. As these two vastly different Greek powers assess each other across the peninsula, the future of their civilizations hangs in the balance.

From the agora to the theater, from the heights of power to the margins of society, here is Athens in all its glory and contradiction - a city where justice and beauty compete with violence and ambition, where tradition clashes with progress, and where gods still walk the earth. Through the lives of politicians and philosophers, priests and playwrights, soldiers and slaves, experience the birth of democracy and the dawn of Western thought.

The first book of an epic series chronicling the myriad minds of the golden age of Athens through the lifetime of Sokrates, ATHENS weaves history and imagination into a tapestry as rich and complex as the city itself. In a world where politics, art, philosophy and religion are inseparable, every choice shapes not just a city, but the future of human thought.

I wrote a fantasy with a lesbian MC!,"This year, I finally did it.   
I wrote the book I used to dream of when I was a kid. 

The kind of book filled with dragons and prophecy. With girls who carry grief like a sword. With love that doesn’t save you, but still matters.  
It’s queer. It’s tender. It’s a little devastating.

✨ *EAGLACH* is for anyone who’s ever stood at the edge of the world and wondered what would happen if they jumped—and what might be waiting when they fall.

*Some stories were never meant to be read.*

In the fractured realm of Keipyin, where memory is sacred and prophecy stirs beneath the surface of silence, Eymir Solis lives a life of quiet study. As a Reader, her role is to witness the past — not to shape the future. But when strange visions begin to haunt her dreams, and old powers awaken in the north, Eymir is drawn into a legacy darker and older than she ever imagined.

Across a land scarred by dragonfire and political unrest, loyalties splinter and the gods remain silent. Love and grief twist into one. And as the fabric of the world begins to tear, Eymir must choose between the truths she’s been taught, and the impossible path before her.

Lyrical, haunting, and deeply human, *EAGLACH* is an epic fantasy about the cost of knowledge, the ache of memory, and what it means to carry the weight of legacy when no one else will.

"A Road Of Magic: A Story Of Ancient Lies, Magic & A World Bound By Both.","[https://imgur.com/a/MvB6b4H](https://imgur.com/a/MvB6b4H)  
Magic is a blessing that destroyed the world two thousand years ago. History is truth and lies written by those who claim victory. And now, from the heart of the World Road, the history of magic will change once again.

For centuries, nations and empires have warred over the World Road. Ishia was one of the weapons in the war. As a Mythslayer for the Legetorum Empire, she was trained to bury hidden truths as well as those seeking them out. But after a fateful night that left her Master dead and a price placed upon Ishia's head, she must survive against the very Empire she once served.

Haunted by a relentless Imperial hunter, Ishia's quest will drag her and others that join her across a world plagued by rising war. But what if the Empire she flees is just a pawn? What if the malicious orcs of the Risen Jungle, the mustering armies of Murdon, and the isolationist rulers of the Elven Isles were all dancing to a tune of trickery? A melody of shadows and magic played by a single, hidden master?

But her path will eventually lead to the World Road, the impossible mountain spire at the center of their world. Not just the rumored birthplace of magic, but the throne of the world’s true history. To unravel the tapestry of myth she find herself woven into, Ishia must first unravel the secrets locked within her soul. In a world where kings are pawns, and magic is more than any could believe, what can a single broken soldier do against a great hand that writes the history of their world?

Experience the beginning of her journey as she races to escape Aleka'Tara and awakens to the truths of magic, the world, and herself in *Awakening,* the first book in the nine-book series *A Road of Magic.*

Hi everyone I want to share my new book here, it's a psychological tech thriller. The Dark Buddha - Too Many Faces is a Series of 3 books, here is the first one, hope you like it!

Step into a world where revolutionary technology meets ancient mystery: AKRec, a virtual reality system promising vivid, life-altering experiences where you can live as someone else, exploring new lives and possibilities. But what if this “ultimate escape” is only the first turn of the key?

Users are emerging with uncanny knowledge and haunting emotions that refuse to fade. The boundaries between fantasy, consciousness, and reality begin to dissolve, revealing unsettling truths about perception, and the “self”. As the line between worlds fades, a darker lie rises to the surface. When every experience challenges what you thought you knew, you’re left facing one terrifying question: when you look in the mirror, whose face do you truly see?

What I Manage - The Loneliest Man,"It has been a year in the making, but I have written my autobiography. Being diagnosed with dyslexia, it was very difficult. I use some AI to help with fixing my sentence structures and also to find some better adjectives to help get my point across. But it is 100% my original work. The topics of depression, sex, drug use and mental illness are discussed but no worries, they are not the main focus.. I have sold a few and the feedback has been very positive. People seem to like my sprinkling of humor throughout the book. I did all the graphics with Corel Photopaint and used M/S Word to write it. I worked hard on the formatting as it was my first book, but it all worked out. A couple people also said they read the 200+ pages in a day or two because it was “riveting”.

Blurb: 

Being rich is hell because when you're rich, everybody wants a piece.

Peter and Esther Brucklehurst are the golden couple of the British Celebrity Scene. Peter was one of the best footballers of his generation. Esther was a successful pop star with some diamond hits. They have everything they want in life, and they know how to spend their money.

On the other side of the tracks, there is Brendan O'Malley and his motley crew of criminal associates. They are dangerous, psychotic, immoral people in a world of shady ethics.

Brendan has a plan, a big one, and an organised approach to his business. Kidnap the Brucklehurst child and demand a huge ransom. Because why should the rich and famous have all the fun?

However, nothing is easy for Brendan, and he has his problems; he has a crew that he can't trust and an ego out of control.

What's Yours is Mine is a fast-paced thriller about a gangster trying to kidnap and ransom the child of the rich and famous, a modern take on the Lindbergh Case.

It runs fast, it reads fast, and it's a helluva lot of fun.

The core of the story is about Brendan O'Malley's ransom of the Brucklehurst child. They have demanded twenty million pounds (paid in escrow) for the return of Spencer Brucklehurst.

The kidnapping reveals issues in the lifestyle of the rich and famous, and the cracks in the seemingly perfect Brucklehurst marriage.

It also reveals the ego-centric world of criminals, as personalities clash and trust runs very thin.

Not since Ed McBain's King's Ransom will you read this exciting kidnapping novel!

Where do i even begin? — Writing book 2 of my fantasy about Leeonir/Speef series(Abd wordering if it begins),"Hey everyone,

I’m currently working on the second book of a fantasy series I started publishing independently. Writing a sequel has proven more challenging than I expected — not just creatively, but emotionally too. I chose to pick up the story exactly where book one ended — with the fall of Eldoria and the rise of Kareed — instead of doing a time jump. Some told me a gap of months or years might help, but… I couldn’t skip the aftermath. I needed to feel it. To write it.

Now I’m translating the early chapters from my native Portuguese into English and constantly asking myself:

- Does the tone carry weight?
- Is the translation fluid enough for native readers?
- And most importantly: does it work as the opening of a sequel?

I’d love honest feedback on those points. Especially from anyone who’s struggled to start a second book after an emotional climax.

Below is the full draft of Chapter 1 in English:

Chapter 1 — The Throne of Ashes

The Fallen Crown

The days that followed Eldoria’s fall dragged forward like festering wounds, throbbing in the sepulchral silence that had enveloped the once-glorious capital. Each dawn rose as an insult to the heavens, and each night descended like a lament without echo, reverberating through devastated halls where grandeur had once dwelt. Fathers walked bereft of children, while orphans wandered stripped even of hope—that final companion of the desperate. The vast metropolis, which had once flowed like a mighty river of voices and trembling banners, now lay mutilated, profaned by devouring flames and the blood that had stained its millennial stones. Eldoria had become a blind queen, seated in solitude upon a throne stripped of all glory. And through the shattered halls of her palace walked a new master.

Kareed.

The survivors whispered his name like a shadow-born incantation, calling him a specter made flesh. Yet it was no ethereal spirit that haunted these corridors—it was muscle, tempered steel, and iron will given human form. He stood tall as an ancient war-tree, his white hair like snow sullied by the soot of conflagration, and his eyes glittered in shifting hues that danced with whatever fury consumed him or arcane magic he wielded. His mere presence was not simply oppressive—it distilled poison into the very air, corrupting the lungs of those who dared breathe in his proximity.

The entire city drew breath beneath the implacable yoke of his dominion. Colossal ogres stalked the cobbled streets like unwelcome lords, spitting orders steeped in hatred and dispensing violence for pure delight in suffering. The pointed-eared elves and men, once masters of marble steps, ornate plazas, and gilded gates, now crawled through shadows like wounded specters in their own homeland. Those who spoke too boldly found eternal silence; those who dared lift their gaze in defiance lost both sight and life together.

Fear had become absolute law, engraved not upon parchments, but upon the scars of the soul.

The Profaned Council

In the pulsing heart of the ruined city, the majestic hall where once the venerable Council of Seven had convened lay defiled—transformed into a macabre altar of shadow-born power. The circular table where kings, rulers, and counselors of bygone eras had shaped entire ages with their wisdom now bore the stains of coagulated blood and sinister remnants of unspeakable sacrifices. The ancestral emblems, silent witnesses to generations of glory, had been erased by the black soot of downfall. In that sacred precinct, the past had been not merely buried, but violated—and from the ashes of its profanation had emerged a dominion of unprecedented darkness.

Kareed moved between the broken pillars with the sinister solemnity of one who defiles sacred tombs, his footsteps echoing over marble wreckage like hammer upon anvil. Across his broad shoulders, he wore a mantle fashioned from the scaled hide of an azure dragon—a gift from Harueel and tangible symbol of his inexorable conquest. His long, pale fingers traced ancient symbols carved into millennial stones, as though invoking arcane promises long forgotten by mortals.

With the dark majesty of a fallen god, he settled upon the throne—not that of Leelinor, for it had been shattered into a thousand fragments during the final battle—but upon a new one, forged by his own hands through forbidden magic. It was a structure of steel black as the starless night, a vast monument to the absolute dominion he exercised over all living creatures. He crossed his legs with the serene calm of one who possessed infinite centuries to rule and contemplate his work. Before him, carved from noble stone adorned with wood salvaged from the ancient council table, stretched a detailed map of the twenty-seven great villages that comprised Eldoria’s domains.

“Three have already knelt in submission,” Kareed murmured, his eyes scanning the carved names like sharpened blades sliding across parchment. “Seven have sent hollow words, empty as drums beaten without rhythm… And four have barricaded themselves like cornered rats in their burrows.”

His hand paused over one name in particular, fingers tracing the letters with almost religious reverence.

“But Zao… Zao remains in absolute silence. And silence, my dear realm, is the most dangerous form of defiance that exists.”

The Bloodhound’s Report

At that precise moment, Harueel entered the hall with measured steps. His armor had been forged in the blazing furnaces of the distant desert, exotic material that molded perfectly to every contour of his warrior’s frame, and his hard eyes, deprived of sleep for countless nights, bore the vacant expression of one who had long ceased to dream. He knelt with the calculated reverence of a faithful warrior—or perhaps of a lesser wolf before the pack’s alpha.

“Zao must fall first,” Kareed declared without lifting his gaze from the map, his voice echoing through the vaulted chambers like a death sentence. “Discover who leads the resistance in those distant lands. Bring me not reports written upon parchment—bring me names carved in blood. And I want you yourself to make them bleed in agony or kneel in submission. Fear, golden promises… or purifying fire. But remember this: flames always speak louder than words.”

Harueel nodded with the coldness of tempered steel.

“As you command, Your Shadow Majesty.”

“Yet it is not Zao that disturbs my rest,” Kareed continued, raising his eyes to contemplate an irregular fissure in the vaulted ceiling, through which gray twilight poured like blood from an ancient wound. “It is the accursed desert that troubles my thoughts. The ancestral land of the red ones. The First Peoples, whose roots delve deeper than mountains.”

He turned slowly, like a predator studying prey, his eyes now blazing like stars aflame.

“How does one hunt ghosts buried beneath a thousand generations of shifting sand? How does one subjugate a people who bury themselves in the depths to live far from sunlight’s touch?”

“They will never come to us willingly,” Harueel replied with the certainty of a war veteran. “We shall have to invade the very bones of the earth. Descend to the depths where their ancestors sleep and tear them from the cradle that has nurtured them for millennia.”

Kareed showed no smile, but his eyes blazed with even fiercer intensity.

“Yes… we shall do exactly that. But before we march upon the sands, let us speak of the royal blood that slipped through our fingers like water.”

The Scattered Heirs

Harueel hesitated for a moment that seemed an eternity.

“They fled to the southern lands, Majesty. We possess no knowledge of their exact refuge, but they carry with them what remains of his sacred name. Three sons of Leelinor, according to whispers from our infiltrated spies. Blood that inspires multitudes. Blood that still weighs upon destiny’s scales.”

Kareed clenched his fists against the carved table with force sufficient to crack stone.

“Hope,” he spat the word as though it were bitter poison. “They carry hope in their veins. And hope is a disease more contagious than plague. A child who hears the name Leelinor whispered upon the wind believes they can save the entire world. This must die before it spreads. Scour every inch of the south. Every village, every forgotten hamlet, every isolated hovel. If there exists a single trace of royal blood… eradicate it without mercy.”

The shadow-king paused, pregnant with menace, touching with reverence the Ring of Thirzammar that adorned his finger.

“And what of the ancestral dragons?”

“Zelmor and Guhile lie dead,” Harueel replied with genuine sorrow. “With them perished the two dragons that served as mounts. We possess no more manipulators of draconic arts. The magical essences of the mountains have been utterly exhausted… the Great Awakening consumed all that remained of arcane power.”

The Dragon’s Promise

Kareed rose with majestic slowness, each movement calculated as ritual. His eyes now gleamed in deep crimson tones, and his presence weighed upon the air like harbinger of imminent death.

“Find Peheef wherever he hides,” he commanded with voice that echoed like distant thunder. “He served Guhile faithfully and knows all the secret passages. Bring me any living soul who has touched an ARK stone and still draws breath. If we possess no dragons to display… we shall appear vulnerable in our enemies’ eyes. And I will never—never—appear weak before anyone whatsoever. This crown is no mere ornamental symbol. It is forged from pure fear, tempered in absolute terror.”

“And what of Thirzammar, Majesty?”

“He still resists my will, but soon it shall not be necessary to control him through force,” Kareed replied with a smile that never reached his eyes. “He will come of his own accord, as a devoted servant. I shall be the fire that consumes him. And he, in turn, shall be mine.”

The Architect of Empire

Harueel approached the carved table with cautious steps.

“Disturbing rumors have reached my ears, Majesty. Voices that whisper beneath the debris of the devastated city. Forgotten subterranean passages. Ancient tunnels. Resistance small as an ember… but still alive and burning.”

“Then let them rot in their underground warrens like rats,” Kareed murmured with royal disdain. “We shall give the city an entirely new face, more beautiful and terrible than what came before. Command the ogres to rebuild every destroyed stone. Let them raise majestic towers fed by ARK force, let us make the city pulse with renewed energy, but now under the command of those who truly know how to manipulate this ancestral power. Force the elves, humans, and any creature that opposes our dominion—let them work until their final breath. Brick laid upon corpse. Stone raised upon spilled blood. I want streets wide enough for grand parades. This shall not be a chaotic reign of destruction… but an empire that will endure for countless millennia.”

He approached the ceiling’s fissure and contemplated the distant horizon with a conqueror’s eyes. Black smoke, moon pale as bone, and distant screams of agony composed the shadow symphony of his nascent realm.

“When they hear the terrible roar echoing across the distant southern forests… when divine wrath falls like devastating tempest upon the earth… they shall know that Eldoria, as it was known, has died forever.”

And from the ashes of its death, something infinitely more terrible was born.",0,0,2025-06-14,Lelio_Fantasy_Writes,Adult - Fantasy,0.33

📖 Pre-order link: https://www.amazon.com/Death-Utopia-Karyn-Skaryd-Mysteries-ebook/dp/B0F7DK5QHD

What’s it about?

Detective Karen Skaryd takes a long-overdue anniversary trip to a luxury resort in the Dominican Republic… only for paradise to turn into a nightmare.

From the depths of my heart: I changed the name of the character I created as a child.,"His name was Speef.

Strange to some — but for me, it was everything. He was the boy I once was. He grew with me, through dreams, battles, pages and silence. He was never “just a name.” He was memory, meaning, and identity.

But many native readers said it didn’t fit. That it sounded childish. That it broke the immersion in a story filled with death, politics, blood and myth.

At first, I resisted. I felt like I was betraying my childhood. Betraying the boy who dreamed this world into being.
But I listened. I reflected. And in the end, I made a choice that brought me peace.

Speef is now Leeonir.
A name born from the same heart — a name that still holds who I am.
A name worthy of the journey. Of the scars. Of the blade.
Leeonir, the Dragon Slayer.

I know most of those who asked me to change it never really cared. Many just wanted something to criticize.
But to those few who truly meant to help — I thank you.
And I invite you to read the story now.

The Prologue and Chapter 1 are available. Just read them.
And if you feel that fire, if something stirs inside you — know this:

Tomorrow, the full book will be free on mi bio for 3 days.
And I believe — if you love fantasy, you will love Leeonir.

This path hasn’t been easy.
But I’ve learned.
I’ve failed.
I’ve tried again.
And I’ve written this world with everything I had.

So now, I share it with you.
Lélio Puggina Jr.

***Prologue***

They said it was only the beginning.
That the dragons would not return.
That the stones would never scream.
That the desert shadows would never cross Eldoria’s skies.
They lied.
I saw fire fall like rain.
I saw ancient gods descend with shattered wings and glassy eyes.
I saw brothers burn standing.
And cities turn to ash before the Council’s silence.
My name is Leeonir.
Not the hero.
Not the chosen one.
Just the one who didn’t kneel when the light was gone.

Eldoria is not a kingdom.
It’s an open wound.
A land of forgotten villages, forests that whisper dead names, and mountains that float above the truth.
The North prays to stone.
The South bleeds for freedom.
The Center pretends it still rules something other than its own ruin.

There are elves who still believe in peace.
Humans who crave revenge.
Ogres who have learned to think.
And something… behind the dragons.
Something that does not sleep.
Something that watches.
I don’t have answers.
Only scars.
And broken promises.
But if you’re reading this, know:
The world doesn’t need legends.
It needs those who remain standing—
Even when everything around them falls.

Because the fire will come again.
And when it does—
I’ll be waiting.



***Chapter 1 – The Roots of Eldoria***

The dragons no longer slept.
That was the first sign something in Eldoria had changed.

In this ancient realm—where forests touch the heavens and rivers shimmer like crystal—the lives of many peoples are bound by a fragile thread.

Eldoria is not just a kingdom.
It is the beating heart of the continent.

Surrounded by twenty-seven villages, each with its own culture, laws, and legacy, the capital rules through the Central Council. These villages differ in faith and custom, but all bend to the Council’s will. In return, they are granted protection, knowledge, and peace.

Some still bear the names of their founders—names heavy with blood, honor, and story.

The world around them is vast and wild.

Lakes hide forgotten secrets.
Swamps whisper in ancient tongues.
Floating mountains slice through the sky like wounds in the heavens.

And above them all… dragons fly.

These beings are more than myth. They are nature’s reckoning. They live among the clouds, far from the quarrels of men and elves. But something has shifted. Their attacks—once as rare as an eclipse—have grown more frequent. The Council fears what it does not yet understand.

To the west: the stone walls of the world—immense mountains hiding peoples long forgotten.
To the north: endless desert, and a volcano that births the strongest metals known.
There dwell the First Peoples—red-skinned warriors with blue-black hair and honey-gold eyes.

Their bodies are iron-forged. They live beneath the sand, in cities carved into stone, and they share a sacred pact with Eldoria.

Across the sea: a restless force. Centaurs—fierce, silent, proud. Once enemies, now held back by a fragile truce. No one truly believes it will hold.

For centuries, the elves ruled Eldoria.
Beautiful. Wise. Deadly.

At the summit stands Leelinor—leader of the mercenaries, sovereign of the realm. Tall and silent, his white hair catches the wind like snow over stone. His green eyes cut through deceit. His scars were carved by dragons. His silence is the weight of burdens older than war.

At his side, the Council of Seven:

• Abhoof, his eldest son—calm, brilliant, master of harvests and trade.
• Guhile, the engineer—obsessed with ARK stones, rare crystals of immense power.
• Zeeshoof, the eldest of them all—guardian of memory, tradition, and loss.
• Groon, the warrior—justice embodied in steel.
• Karg, the ogre—muscle and mind united, who seeks peace through strength.
• Caroline, the human—elegant, sharp, relentless in her pursuit of unity.

Together, they hold the realm—barely.

Tensions boil.
Some ogres resist.
Some humans conspire.
Some elves thirst for war.

And in the center of it all stands Leeonir.

Seventeen years old.
Son of Leelinor.
Hair white as winter.
Eyes—one green, one blue.

He trains every day.
He doubts every night.

His swordmaster, Edduuhf, once told him:
“The blade isn’t meant to kill. It’s meant to protect. To guide. You only carry it when you know where you’re going.”

But Leeonir doesn’t know.
Not yet.

He is torn between the strength of his brother Luucner, the clarity of Abhoof, the compassion of his sister Deehia, and the quiet shadow of a father who never truly sleeps.

Leeonir’s world is about to change.

The dragons are waking.
The Council is breaking.
And soon, Leeonir will stand at the center of it all.

Whether he wants to or not.

"Healing isn't linear. It is chaotic, messy, circular and takes a detour through your savings bank account.","***Congratulations on Your Red Flag*** is the unhinged, funny, emotionally raw book you didn’t know you needed. It’s not a 10-step guide to wellness. It’s a mirror reflecting your patterns, coping mechanisms, and spirals with sarcasm and soul. Think healing, but with chaos, snack breaks, and plot twists.

The Intelligence Spiral: How Expansive Learning Outperforms Linear Expertise,"[**Kindle eBook (Also Available on Kindle Unlimited)**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FB8THFT3) **|** [**Paperback**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FBFPTDRX)

Genre: Self-Help, Productivity

About **The Intelligence Spiral**:

**As uncertainty reshapes our world faster than ever, it’s not** ***what we know*** —it’s ***how we learn*** **that defines our edge.**

*The Intelligence Spiral* breaks away from the myth of linear expertise and invites us into a new model of growth—one where learning loops upward, across domains, through cycles of exploration, connection, and reinvention. This is not a call to abandon depth, but a guide to building intelligence that adapts, integrates, and evolves with the world around us.

Rooted in neuroscience, cognitive science and real-world insight, this book uncovers why our current systems reward predictability over potential—and how that’s no longer enough. It introduces a powerful framework to build Spiral Intelligence: a way of thinking that thrives in uncertainty, multiplies insight across fields, and keeps our learning alive for a lifetime.",3,0,2025-06-08,Todd_Dell,Non-Fiction,1.0
"altered generationZ - A Poetic, Spiritual Memoir - Available on Kindle Unlimited and Amazon","[https://imgur.com/a/2QegoGg](https://imgur.com/a/2QegoGg)

*Feeling alone or struggling to find peace in life? You're not alone. Amidst the emotional storms of this laughably absurd modern world, we must reconnect with our shared humanity and the spirit of life which we have been conditioned to suppress and neglect.*

In a laughably absurd world and time in which humanity seems to have lost its mind–a time when a new form of sentience is being invented, when computers are inching closer to being capable of simulating nature, and when an orange man with a poster board is yelling something about “liberation” as he flips the world order on its head–it is natural that those just now growing up have completely lost sight of their sense of Self. It is natural that my generation–Generation Z–and following generations find ourselves lost, seemingly incapable of getting even a single foothold to ground ourselves, our minds trapped behind social media algorithms, existential crises, and youthful ignorance.

To put it simply, we are scared and confused. It feels as though we were born on the Titanic after it had already begun sinking. Whether it be ecological collapse, the prospect of nuclear war, economic exploitation, political polarization, aliens, a technological revolution so unfathomable that not even tech CEOs know what’s going on… well, let’s just say that my generation does not seem alone in being scared and confused. The only difference is that we are just starting out in life, our experiences confined to a sinking ship without a captain.

This book is my personal guide (so far, as I am only 24) on how to find greater peace in life amidst such a laughably absurd world.

  
**Tropes**: The Seeker's Journey, Letters from the Edge of the Modern World, Digital Dystopia Meets Spiritual Awakening, The Postmodern Confessional.

*Devastated by his infertility diagnosis, husband Phil Henderson pushes his wife into a new lifestyle that opens both their eyes...*

Phil Henderson was a broken man. His sperm count was zero, his dreams of fatherhood obliterated. His wife, Gemma, a nurturing primary school teacher, still ached for a baby. In a desperate bid to heal their shared heartbreak and give Gemma the child she craved, Phil devised “Conception Plan B” – a plan so audacious, so deviant, it would either destroy them or forge their marriage anew in the fires of unimaginable pleasure.

The plan: Natural Insemination. The donor: Leo Maxwell, a charismatic Kentish Town artist with a reputation for creativity and, as Gemma would soon discover, a cock that was a masterpiece in its own right. Phil’s condition for this deeply personal “procedure”? He had to watch. Every touch. Every thrust. Every single, intimate detail as another man took his wife.

What began as a clinical, awkward arrangement quickly unravelled. Leo wasn’t just a sperm donor; he was a sexual artist, and Gemma, initially hesitant, found her body responding to his skilled hands and impressive length in ways she’d never imagined. Her small gasps turned into throaty moans, her dutiful compliance into eager participation. Phil watched, his initial shame morphing into a raw, undeniable arousal.

**“Conception Plan B”** is an explicit, no-holds-barred dive into the dark, thrilling world of hotwifing, stag & vixen dynamics, and the mind-blowing pleasure of MFM. If you crave stories of husbands watching their wives get thoroughly used, of women discovering their inner sluts, and of marriages reignited by extreme sexual adventure, then prepare for Phil and Gemma’s journey. This isn’t just a tale of making a baby; it’s about birthing a whole new kind of lust.

**TROPES:**  Hotwife, Stag & Vixen, Voyeur Husband, Breeding Kink, MFM

**TRIGGER WARNING:**

* Infertility and the emotional distress associated with it.
* Medical procedures and discussions related to reproductive health.
* Voyeurism (consensual within the couple’s dynamic).
* Explicit sexual content including: Natural Insemination (NI) depicted as sexual intercourse, oral sex, anal sex, MFM (male-female-male) threesomes, graphic descriptions of sexual acts and anatomy, ejaculation (including descriptions of semen on body/face), and strong sexual language.
* Power dynamics within sexual encounters.
* The female protagonist secretly taking contraceptive pills while her husband believes they are trying to conceive (this becomes a shared, unspoken agreement).

In the prehistoric parts of the planet, ancient ecosystems endure – lost worlds dominated by razor-toothed, flesh-eating dragons.  
  
The Komodo monitor – gluttonous, ravenous, cannibalistic – top predator on an isolated cluster of tropical islands.  
  
When the ragged group of castaways stagger ashore, they think they are saved.  
  
Instead they find themselves prey.  
  
But they are not alone in this lost world – and dragons are not the only predators.  
  
Reptilian savagery gives way to human nature – primal instinct becomes betrayal and murder – and they will all soon learn that sins of the past are never truly buried.  
  
But the lost world knows no judgment – and survival knows no sin.  
  
The dragons wait for them all.

I wrote this alone. No team. No publisher. No money. Just a dream. My epic fantasy novel is now on Amazon — and this is a taste of it.,"Hey,

I’m an indie author from Brazil, and I just launched my first fantasy novel in English on Kindle Unlimited. I wrote, translated, and published it all by myself — with zero budget, just heart and obsession.

If you love epic fantasy that hits hard — with dragons, war, emotion, and legacy — please consider giving it a shot.

📖 Title: SPEEF – THE DRAGON SLAYER
🔥 Subtitle: Blood of Ash and Flame
🛒 Link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FBD9YF6Q ← (FREE with Kindle Unlimited!)

⸻

⚔️ A GLIMPSE OF THE STORY:

“I watched them die,” he said, voice hoarse and broken.
“So many… I promised we’d return with the mission complete. That this was for peace. That I was the shield. But I wasn’t. I was the twisted blade that led them to death.”

Speef knelt before him. Reached for his father’s hand and gripped it, firm.
“No. This isn’t your burden alone. Yes, we were deceived—But we’re still breathing. And that means we still have a choice. We still have a path.”

Leelinor raised his hands, placed them gently on either side of Speef’s face. For a moment, his eyes lit with something ancient—something proud.
“I expect great things from you, Speef. You carry my blood… but you surpass it. You are what Eldoria needs—if we are ever to know peace again.”

And then—
The sky tore open.
A roar that fractured the bones of the world.
A dragon—colossal beyond reason. Black scales shimmered with molten gold. Wings unfurled with thunder. Forests shattered. Shadows swallowed the land.

And then came the roar.
Blue fire. The fire of a she-dragon. Majestic. Dense. Hotter than any hell ever spoken of.
This wasn’t war. This was obliteration.

⸻

If you’ve ever dreamed of seeing a new world rise from ash and sorrow — one where hope still burns in the darkest places — this is that book.

🙏 If you can read it, share it, or just leave a review — you’re helping a nobody from South America fight for a dream.

Thank you so much.

The Noose of Thorns
Freebooters book 3

600+ pages of epic fantasy, dark fantasy, romance and adventure!

Epic fantasy. Grimdark, and elements of Dark Fantasy. Romance and occasional spice. Deep characters and long plot arcs. Mercenaries. Welcome to the Freebooters.

The Noose of Thorns is the third installment in the immersive Freebooters series and the fourteenth book in the expansive World of Espa saga. This chapter plunges deeper into the lives of the Freebooters, a storied mercenary company with millennia of history, as they navigate the aftermath of pivotal changes from their foothold in the bustling Freeport of Braid.

The narrative follows the ascent of Jael, formerly known as “Piss,” who emerges as a promising protégé of the legendary swordsman Eruch, the Twilight Blade. Alongside him is Danni Singlehand, a formidable one-armed warrior, as they unravel the secrets of a sinister cult.

Meanwhile, Tonkes deepens the Freebooters' entanglements with the labor senators of Braid, immersing himself in the city's complex political landscape. Varilla, now captain of the Freebooters, adeptly juggles her roles as a mother, an archmage, and a leader, while Eruch embraces his duties as Warmaster, transitioning from frontline combat to strategic oversight.

"Hiroshi, tale of a Sumotori - Martial Fantasy / YA - Available on Kindle Unlimited","[Cover](https://imgur.com/a/KF1MrtV_)

This is what might be the greatest (only?) sumo-centric fantasy story ever told! 

The Blurb: 

Hiroshi has always dreamed of becoming a sumotori. His late father was always respected in the local sumo scene. This was Hiroshi's ticket to a local tournament. When he wins that he might be able to compete in the capital city.

He's recruited by the legendary Oyakata Kenjiro and goes the fabled Hajima stable. There he learns being a sumotori is harder than he ever expected. He has a master who is strict and unforgiving, an Oyakata who seems to be losing his grip and a stable bully that seems to be set on making his life hell.

Caught between his desire to honor his father and the unsettling truths that come to light, Hiroshi must decide what kind of sumotori-and man-he will become.

In this gripping coming-of-age story of strength, honor, and sacrifice, Hiroshi's journey is one of self-discovery and resilience as he learns that the path to greatness is never simple, and the price of legacy may be higher than he ever thought.

What Wounds Keep Warm - Dark Horror Romance - Available On Kindle/Amazon,"""What Wounds Keep Warm"" isn’t just a book; it’s a descent. Twisted, erotic, and soaked in blood, it drags you bare into the darkest corners of desire and survival. If you crave horror that fucks with your head and your heart, you’ve just found your next obsession.


He was meant to become a god. Instead, he became a vessel for suffering.

Riven remembers nothing of the man he once was—only the ritual that broke him. Seven minds are forced into one fragile body by a cult hungry to birth a new divinity. They failed.
Now, he is hollow. Fragmented. A blind-eyed wretch wandering through a world of ash and silence, his name not his own but a scar.
He does not feel. He does not dream.
Only in pain does he remember he's alive.

Then comes the beast.

The Minotaur who finds him is brutal, massive, and silent—a creature carved from scars and rage. He offers no comfort, only possession. His loyalty is violent. His affection is a form of punishment. But he does not abandon Riven. And when he touches him, the silence inside begins to stir.

Then comes the demon.

Veyrix is not human. Not even close. A creature twisted with old hunger and new desire, with a mouth made for lies and a gaze that strips souls bare. He does not want love. He wants to surrender. He wants to taste Riven’s ruin and feed the fire still smouldering inside him.
He is temptation incarnate. A predator with charm.
And somehow, Riven lets him in, too.

Together, the three form something fractured and feral—a bond forged through pain, shaped by obsession, and tested by the ghosts clawing their way out of the past.

Because something is waking.

Strange omens whisper through the land. Bodies vanish. Eyes watch from shadowed places. The cult that made Riven never died—they only went quiet, hiding their rituals behind masks and silence, their work unfinished.
And whatever they tried to summon didn’t disappear.
It waits.

As their desires twist tighter and the lines between pleasure and torment blur, the truth begins to rise from beneath the rot.
This is not just a story of survival.
It is a reckoning.

The End Times According to Buford – comedic post-apocalyptic survival fiction,"When an EMP knocks out everything, folks start losing their minds.  
Buford “Lucky” Lee? He grabs his turnout gear, a boiled egg, and keeps movin’.

Armed with nothing but real-world grit, bad timing, and one very aggressive chicken, Buford stumbles through the apocalypse without any clue what’s really going on—and somehow keeps coming out okay. Kind of.

What follows is a darkly funny, backwoods survival tale featuring duct tape, porch logic, and people who keep mistaking Buford for someone important.

**The End Times According to Buford** is Book One of a southern-fried survival series about blind luck, bad plans, and the world’s least likely apocalypse survivor.

Greek Mythology Fantasy,"Hi! I’m an indie author, and I recently released Trial of the Gods, a fantasy novel with a morally gray sapphic lead, myth-inspired worldbuilding, and a slow-burn connection that blooms in the ruins of betrayal and survival.

I didn’t write this book to be marketable—I wrote it because I needed a story where the girl doesn’t have to choose between love and strength. Where softness doesn’t mean weakness. Where queer love is part of the fabric of the world, not the twist.

If you like:
● Women who don’t fit neatly into boxes
● Greek mythology vibes
● Found family 

And a heroine who has to choose between the kingdom and her family...

Then maybe Trial of the Gods belongs on your Kindle or on your bookshelf. 

It’s on Kindle Unlimited right now, and honestly, every read, download, or review means the world to me.

"It took me four years to finally finish this book. ""Deathseeker - Tomb Of Cinders"" Free (May 30-June 5)","**History has been erased, the Divine Government has made sure that the knowledge of the past will remain forgotten for ever. The dead, however, never forget.**

Hello! This novel had been in the works for a couple of years. I published it last August and it will be free on Kindle until 05/06/2024.

Name: Deathseeker - Tomb Of Cinders

Amazon Link: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCGNZ32C](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCGNZ32C)

Genre: Fantasy / Dark Fantasy

Pages: 257

Price: 4.99 / Free until 05/06/2024

Description:  
History has been erased. The world is surrounded by a dark smoke which births aberrations.

Karan, a Deathseeker, leads a group of scholars on a perilous mission. Their goal: to unveil the secret past of their world. With all records buried, Karan employs an unconventional method to unearth past events - he converses with the souls of the deceased who experienced them.

As war ominously approaches, Golind Inadil, one of the most ruthless men on the planet, must align himself with the Deathseeker. Their objective: to thwart his father’s ambitions of seizing power in the Queendom of Farkline.

Merlika’s life takes a harrowing turn when she falls under the influence of a manipulative lover. As her world crumbles, she becomes haunted by the tormented souls of the departed. Unexpected salvation arrives in the form of Eirik, a half-mad criminal. Together, they embark on a global journey in search of the truth.

The answers to all their questions lie within one of the world’s most ancient and heavily guarded historical sites - the Tomb of Cinders.

Note:

I was greatly inspired by books such as the Wheel Of Time which follow a cast of ever changing and developing characters through the mysteries of an ever shifting world. If you like that type of stuff and you enjoy slow burn world-building related mysteries, this is right up our alley. Just know that the characters are unreliable narrators and that not everything is as it seems.

Authored a children's activity book for the first time.,"As a kid from the early 2000s, my main source of entertainment used to be activity / story books and animated tv shows.

I have vague memories of these bright colorful and beautiful stories that I used to read growing up which made me feel like I was also a part of these tales. I also spent a lot of time coloring and drawing particularly fashion inspired things and also used to create my own paper cutout activities related to dress-up and art.

This was until I got introduced to the internet and flash games which then led to me and my siblings drawing away from these physical activities and more towards an unhealthy amount of screen-time.

Lately I had been having flashbacks of these cute and wholesome books I used to have in those screen-free days and decided to make one of my own with KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing).

If you share the same memories as I do from back then or you have or know children who would love a similar book, do check mine out on Amazon.

Since this was my first time creating this, I would appreciate your feedback.

TIA!

Sinners Game - Deathmatch Thriller,"**Sinners Game** is an adult oriented thriller following a last man standing deathmatch (or Battle Royale situation, in more videogame related terminology) across the state of Massachusetts. One man must face not only the darkest parts of his enemies, but soon enough the darkness of humanity itself, all while trying desperately not to be consumed and lost within during his quest for survival and answers.

**Description:** Seven deadly sins. Seven deadly Sinners. One man who will judge them all. Eli, an everyday average guy, is thrown headlong into a vicious fight for his life in the form of a last man standing deathmatch put on by an unknown force from the shadows of society, the reward being the promise of power reserved to the likes of God. Seven people are chosen, each one representing one of the seven cardinal sins, which their personality and methods reflect. Along with these people is Eli, chosen for reasons unbeknownst to him, forced to fight to survive against the seven other contestants, each striving for victory. No one knows who the other contestants are, and their only hint is in the form of a phone application which displays the location of the other players once every hour. Armed with this, his gun and his will to live, Eli sets off in an effort to survive. What begins as pure survival, soon turns into a long road of suffering, unanswered questions and a quest for revenge. Eli will be forced to face more than just his opponents; in the process he will have to face the darkest parts of himself and those that reside within every human being. The game is just the beginning, a means to an end, and that end will cost so much more than he ever would have expected.

Matt can't help but be intrigued by Suzy's quirky personality and her rules. What he fails to mention? That he’s ***Detective*** Matt Larson of the NYPD. And he’s investigating a criminal gang whose trail unexpectedly leads to Suzy’s doorstep.

Now, Suzy’s juggling a crush she didn’t see coming and the looming threat of danger. Will she rewrite her rulebook for love, or will her secrets—and Matt’s badge—keep them apart?

**What to Expect:**

* Slow-burn romance (A lot of ""Will They-Won't They"" back and forth.)
* A secondary Mafia Romance (Who doesn't love ***Love*** with a touch of danger?)
* Third person POV (It's your lucky day!)

"Echoes of Glass: A Visual Memoir, of Self Harm, Depression and Fragments of Renewal","Hi everyone,

I’d like to quietly introduce my first and only self-published project, ***Echoes of Glass*****.** This is a 30-page illustrated memoir that explores generational trauma, self-harm, depression, and the often-overlooked growing pains of adolescence.

I began writing ***Echoes of Glass*** out of desperation—as a letter to my daughter when I felt completely helpless and unsure how to carry the pain we both inherited. In the process of creating this book for her, I found myself unpacking my own childhood wounds and, unexpectedly, beginning to heal.

This project is especially close to my heart and may resonate with mothers, teenagers navigating similar struggles, or anyone who knows the weight of inherited pain and loss. My hope is that these pages offer a sense of witness and understanding, wherever you are on your journey.

Thank you for letting me share this small, vulnerable piece of myself with you.

Available in paperback/ Kindle: [Amazon.com: Echoes of Glass: A Memoir of Brokenness, Shadows, and the Fragments of Renewal: 9798284634851: Lai, Jean: Books](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9W75ZKQ)

Paperback: $10/ Kindle: $4

P/s: A little about me: I’m Chinese-Malaysian, currently living in The Hague, Netherlands. Navigating life between these two cultures has shaped a lot of how I see the world and the stories I tell. I want to be clear—I don’t see myself as a healer or someone with all the answers. This project is simply my attempt to make sense of inherited pain, both for myself and my daughter. I hope it resonates with others,

Hey folks —

For a limited time, the entire **SELF Series** is free on Kindle. That’s four full books on reality, perception, and being real — told with sarcasm, recursion, and the occasional existential crisis.



Here’s what you get:



* **The SELF Trilogy** – a smart-ass breakdown of what the self even is.
* **EVERFOLD** – what reality is (mechanically, mathematically, structurally).
* **SIGNALCRAFT** – how you collapse the world through perception.
* **FIELDWORK** – how to live with all of this without going nuts.





They’re weird, philosophical, and occasionally life-altering.

Jay Song and Gio Rivera are the iconic couple in the Esports world of Stormy Horizons. They are dubbed the most favored duo with the best team chemistry. Only, it has been eight years. Now, retired with different careers, they drift towards the end of their relationship, except neither is able to truly let go.

Still living together at the same house, keeping their breakup a secret, they find themselves in the midst of a party hosted by Jay's rich family while keeping with the act. But one drunken habit thrusts them to a whole new level of pretending as a married couple.

But marriage, even fake, not only forces them closer, it also attracts the inevitable—a promotion that will alter the trajectory of their lives. As they rekindle their love, they have to choose which is more important—their respective career or each other?

I finally published my first horror novel – What Reads Us – and it still doesn’t feel real,"Hey everyone,  
After two years of scribbling in notebooks, editing until my brain leaked, and debating whether I should set the manuscript on fire, I’m proud (and slightly terrified) to say that my debut horror novel is finally live.

It’s called ***What Reads Us***, and it’s about a small-town medical examiner who discovers a mysterious black book on the body of a local girl. He reads it—because, of course, he does—and very quickly realizes that **some stories don’t want to be told... they want to be lived.**  
Now the dead won’t stay dead, reality is warping, and something ancient is reading him back.

It’s part psychological horror, part supernatural dread, and entirely too personal.

🩸 If you’re into:

* Creeping tension over cheap jump scares
* Books that know they exist
* Grief, guilt, and the monsters behind your eyes
* A touch of dark humor (because I’m a horror writer who owns pugs)

Congratulations on Your Red Flags!,"**For years, I kept choosing intensity over ease**. Whether it was in relationships, work, or even hobbies. I told myself I was evolving, but I was really just intellectualizing my pain and calling it progress. It took me a long time to realize **I wasn’t reacting to** ***this moment***\*\*, I was reacting to\*\* ***then***\*.\* To the blueprints I inherited, patterns I kept replaying.

Then I wrote about my journey and published my first book on Amazon KDP: **Congratulations on Your Red Flags!** It is not them, it is you.

This is not a typical self-help book. This is not your ""Therapists hate this one trick"" kind of book. This is not a seven-step guide to fixing your life. **This book is a roller coaster ride of red flags, honesty, humor, fun mini-games, chaos, and uncomfortable truths.** **This is a mirror, not a manual.**

It talks about emotional avoidance, fake growth, coping mechanisms, and how we subconsciously form patterns in our life. One of the chapters talks about how self-soothing is for babies, dogs, literally everybody else but the one who is carrying the red flag. The tone is dry satire, for example: **Healing isn't linear, it is circular with a detour through your savings bank account.** It is a funny and slightly unhinged take on healing from somebody who was in the middle of the storm. It is sure to make you reflect about yourself, and your life.

There, in the shadows, she met him.

Bound by a pact forged in desperation, she became bride to a being feared across both worlds—one whose touch burns, yet whose eyes hold centuries of longing.

Now, she walks between fire and flesh, light and ash—torn by duty, haunted by desire.

Devil's Embrace: Volume 1 - Author: Damein Jordon,"In the heart of World War II, Europe burns—and two women from different worlds are drawn together by fate and fire.

Princess Alica Rosa of Yugoslavia is on a desperate diplomatic mission to Rome, seeking support against the looming German threat. Instead, she finds betrayal, captivity, and a terrifying glimpse of a much darker war—one waged not just with bullets, but with ancient powers and forgotten evils.

Mara, a demon accidentally summoned to Earth decades ago, has survived in hiding among mortals. But when the Nazis capture her using forbidden arcane tools, her escape sets off a chain of events that intertwines her destiny with Alica’s.

Bound by a spontaneous and unbreakable soul contract, Alica and Mara must navigate a world unraveling into supernatural chaos. Zombies, occult rituals, hellhounds, and ancient relics are only the beginning. As the Axis powers dig into forbidden magics, the line between earthly war and otherworldly horror begins to blur.

To save a nation—and perhaps the world—this unlikely pair must defy enemies mortal and demonic, forge unshakable trust, and confront horrors that even demons fear.

**Katy Keller** wants to fall in love. Thirty-two and single, she’s watched happily ever after happen for one of her best friends, and now she’s ready for her own romance novel-worthy shot at forever. If only she can find herself a man who epitomises book boyfriend energy (bonus points if he can fill out a pair of Wranglers).

What do you get when a skeptic writes an astrology book? This.,"***The Secret of Astrology -*** **by David Khourie**

This isn't your typical astrology book—or much of a book at all. *The Secret of Astrology* is the ultimate gag gift for anyone who's a little *too* into their star sign… or not into it at all.

What starts like a legit 150-page guide—with chapter headers, page numbers, witty endorsements, and a heartfelt dedication—reveals itself in Chapter One with just a few words of actual text. The rest? Blissfully blank. Perfect for journaling, doodling, or letting the absurdity sink in.

For skeptics with a sense of humor  
For believers who can take a joke  
For anyone who needs a coffee table conversation starter

Growing up in a time of war is hard. Toss in sex, drugs, rock n' roll, the draft, family issues, and the realization that he might be gay, and Nick's journey is more than complicated. It doesn't help that he's secretly in love with Paul. Suicide alert.

Paul's journey is complicated by his unrelenting conflict with his father, his conscience driven resistance to military service, and his romance with Katie. The fact that his best friend Nick struggles to reconcile with his own nature, only comes to light late in the story.

Katie struggles to align her conservative Catholic upbringing with the rise of feminism, the challenges of the Pill, and the sexual freedom it brings.

These three protagonists reveal their thoughts and their different perspectives on the same events, as they experience all the craziness at the beginning of the 1970s. Smell the pot smoke. Adults only. Much of the story is true.

Drunk and Bloody - FREE 48 hours,"Grim, filthy, and unrepentantly horny, this standalone tale blends high magic with gutter violence and bathhouse politics, where everyone’s lying, everyone's spicy, and absolutely no one is getting out clean.

A quick glimpse into the world of the Freebooters, the storied millennia old mercenary company. In an effort to attract some readers to this series, this short story, around 12,000 words is about everyone's favorite drunken magus: Brannon.

Drunk and Bloody is a darkly comic plunge into the underbelly of Imperial City, where magic is sold, debts are blood-bound, and betrayal comes with a smile. Brannon, a sardonic fourth-rank magus with more debt than sense, takes one last job for the Society of Intervention: rob an old bookseller with a dangerous past and steal a handful of cursed trinkets. Easy coin, until it's not.
Caught between pleasure-crazed assassins, double-crossing courtesans, and an artifact that makes moondust look like tea leaves, Brannon must claw his way out using only wit, spite, and an alarming tolerance for pain.

"The devil I loved- romance, psychological, dark, erotic- available on Wattpad.","“He was my tormentor. Now, he's my only way out.""

For years, Lorain has lived under the shadow of Harry's cruelty. The boy who made her life hell in school, the one who ensured she never forgot his name, he was nothing but a nightmare she hoped to leave behind. But when fate pulls them back together, she begins to realize that Harry isn't the same person he once was.

Or maybe... he never was.

What starts as an unsettling act of kindness from her former bully spirals into something darker, an obsession, a game of control, and a truth buried so deep it threatens to shatter everything. Because Harry's world isn't just built on violence and power, it's built on lies. And the biggest lie of all? The one that kept Lorain from understanding the real danger she was in.

Reid, a name she's always trusted, hides secrets of his own. A part of a family that's spent years locked in a bitter war with Harry's, he's been watching, waiting. For what, Lorain doesn't know. But when she finds herself caught between two forces more dangerous than she ever imagined, she realizes too late, she was never just a bystander. She was the prize.

And in the end, she may have to rely on the one person she swore she'd never trust.

Because the real threat isn't the war between Reid and Harry. It's what happens when she discovers the truth about why it started.

And why it always led back to her.-

ONCE A HERO - Alternate-World Military Action Romance,"Zuri believes in freedom, compassion, and every person's right to equal, fair treatment under the law, all of which are sorely lacking after the government and military are hijacked by Middercia's power-hungry leaders. She is among the minority Coalitionists who are fighting to wrest her country back from tyranny, but her hope is tested daily as their numbers dwindle. What they need is a miracle. What they get is a dishonored war hero imprisoned for a senseless mass murder who refuses to join their cause.

Captain Kane is a career military, highly decorated soldier with a deadly secret. Even after Zuri buys his freedom from an alien-run cesspit of a prison, his infamous past and constant fear of harming others imprison him as securely as the steel box in which he spent the last three years. During his court-martial, the media sealed his fate by making him one of the most recognizable figures in military history; while he can conceal his face, nothing can hide his imposing stature. When Zuri and her team show up to aid the large refugee camp that formed adjacent to his forest sanctuary, he knows it is only a matter of time before he is discovered.

Although Zuri knows a wartime relationship with a convicted military criminal is doomed from the start, she cannot deny her physical attraction to the man when she sees him again. And as they join forces to keep the refugees safe, she comes to recognize the compassionate, yet tortured, soul residing within.

Kane fights to resist his growing feelings for Zuri. He has no future and refuses to destroy hers. And as the war rages, threatening not only Middercia's very existence but that of the people he has helped and protected, he is prepared to give his life to save their democracy.

"I Wrote a Soft, Strange Fantasy Series About Magic, Memory, and Mildly Cursed Royalty","Hi. I accidentally wrote five books. It took me too long, longer than I'd care to admit.

It started small—just a story about a boy with too much magic and not enough patience. Then it got bigger. There were old wards, forgotten names, lost cities, talking birds, and a kingdom that feels a bit too tired to keep going.  
And somehow, it all stuck together.

The series isn’t epic fantasy exactly. There are no dragons on the cover, no long prophecies, no world-ending evil. Just a quiet kind of danger—the kind that seeps in through dreams and grief and the people you love too much to lose.

There *is* a crown. There are dragons as well, but they are probably not what you'd expect.  
There’s also a lot of soft hands almost touching.  
And yes, someone cries in a library. More than once.

The books lean quiet, character-focused, occasionally poetic, occasionally very stupid. If you like stories that spiral slowly, that unravel instead of explode—this might be your kind of thing.

Books One to Four are out on Amazon, Five is almost live, and Book Six is in the works. I’m very tired. And very proud.

Hi! I wrote a three-book sci-fi adventure series perfect for readers 12 and up. It's set in the near future after an alien invasion and features a teen main character. The entire series is highly rated and available on Kindle Unlimited. Here is the blurb for the first book:

All fourteen-year-old Bryce Doubleday wants is to be safe from the Imjac, the alien invaders who conquered Earth and killed his parents. But when he and his cousin are captured by the aliens and taken to an island prison camp, he knows he must fight for his life.  
  
Forced to mine for the ruthless aliens, Bryce makes two key discoveries: he has an unnatural skill with alien technology, and the tunnels of the mine hold a substance toxic to the Imjac. Even with these realizations, freedom seems an impossible dream. Alien guards constantly monitor the prisoners’ movements, and, worse, the island sits hundreds of miles from the mainland.

But when Bryce learns of a hidden danger, the choice becomes clear: escape or die.

"I wrote a book about existence, loneliness, and purpose — without making it too deep or too dull.","Ever asked yourself why you’re here but felt like most books either over-philosophize it or turn it into a self-help cliché?

I’ve been there.

It’s Lonely at the Top is my attempt to explore what it really means to exist — especially when you feel different, misunderstood, or like success has put you on an island. It’s part memoir, part thought experiment, part call to action for anyone who’s ever felt the weight of their own mind.

I tried to make it readable for everyone — not too academic, not too shallow. From solitary confinement to second chances, from 3D printing to the idea that maybe even God got lonely... this book is for thinkers, dreamers, and people who’ve been told they’re “too much.”

It’s not just about being at “the top.” It’s about what it costs to climb, and what it means to find meaning once you're there.

If you’ve ever felt like you don’t quite fit in — this might be the conversation you’ve been looking for.

THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTI SURVIVING ADOPTION AT BIRTH INTO THE HOME OF A PSYCHOPATHIC PAEDOPHILE On Amazon Kindle and paperbacknon,"Book overview
A story for the broken, the pissed off, and the ones who refused to stay small.

I didn’t write this book to be liked. I wrote it because silence almost killed me.

The Count of Monte Cristi is not a redemption arc wrapped in bow-tied trauma clichés. It’s a detonation. A survivor’s war cry. Born into a house draped in God and cash, I was adopted by a man who wore respectability like a mask—and hid unspeakable evil underneath. He was my father. And he was a predator.

This is the truth I was never supposed to tell. The beatings. The gaslighting. The years locked in rooms and trapped in silence. I escaped that house, only to end up in another kind of hell—the military, where war gave me new ghosts to bury. I drank to forget. I dove deep into the ocean just to feel free. And somewhere in the pressure and silence of the deep, I started to breathe again.

This is my story—raw, jagged, honest. For the adoptees silenced by praise and denial. For the veterans carrying invisible wounds. For anyone whose pain was buried beneath a smile.

There’s no polish here. Just blood, bone, and fire. But if you’ve ever felt like you were born in a cage and still found a way to fly—you’ll see yourself in these pages.

You weren’t supposed to survive.

But you did.

And now?

You’re dangerous.

*One rose from disgrace to become God's chosen hero. The other, buried beneath a fallen kingdom, struck a pact with darkness. As war looms, the two Princes must choose--fight for themselves, or die for their fathers' dreams.*

Dragons breathe once more, and pillars of light pierce the tortured sky. 

Unification has failed. The High Empire is in chaos, beset with rebellion from all sides, and The Powers stoke the fires of war.

Torran Xandromen, heir to The High Throne, fought for years to return to his father’s side. But at the cusp of ultimate victory, he was betrayed, his forces routed. Defying death, he struck down Flameheir, a monster amongst monsters, saving his troops and turning the tide of battle. 

However, war has changed. The swords of the past have returned to the hands of men, punching holes through the clouds, and souls pay for spells that shatter armies. 

Chosen by The Divinity to save the world, Torran must embrace the path laid out for him, or rebel against fate. 

He is not alone. Six others have been blessed for their sacrifice: 

Scarolette, a scribe who risks it all for love.

Ilidar, a guardsman wrestling with responsibility.

Jhett, a galley slave who dreams of freedom.

Leafsong, a noble plagued by mysterious visions.

Flind, a scullion pursuing her own justice.

Absolute—a monk searching for his place in it all.

In the shadows, Viktor Eridion, son of the enemy, swears revenge. Allying with The Adversary and his demonic horde, he orchestrates a plot that pits Nations against each other and turns friends into foes. As confrontation looms, Viktor must choose to rise above his legacy, or succumb to the dark ideals he has inherited.

Beyond it all, Unification, Order, and Division each vie for control, and their conflict threatens to tear reality apart. It is up to the world’s broken champions to muster a defense, for steel strikes steel with a thunderous clash. 

And everything hangs in the balance.

I Just Published a Children’s Book Inspired by Irish Folklore – Would Love Your Thoughts,"Hi everyone,

I’m an independent author from Ireland and I’ve just released a new children’s book that I’ve been working on for the past year — it’s called **J*****ames and the Magic Sliotar***\*\*.\*\*

The story is rooted in hurling culture and Irish mythology, following a young boy chosen to fulfil an ancient prophecy through the spirit of our national games.

The book was written to inspire pride, imagination, and a deeper connection to hurling among younger generations—celebrating not only the sport itself, but the community, values, and heritage that make it so special.

The book was written with kids aged 6–13 in mind (though I’ve heard from a few adults who enjoyed it too!).

As a lifelong lover of Irish stories, I wanted to create something that celebrates our culture in a fun and accessible way for young readers, whether they’re here in Ireland or part of the diaspora abroad.

If you’re a parent, teacher, librarian, or just someone who loves Irish storytelling, I’d be honoured if you gave it a look.

Here’s a link to find out more / order a copy:  
👉 [Link To Book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0F2F5NZR5)

And if anyone here has tips for sharing books in Irish communities or getting them into schools/libraries, I’d really welcome the advice 🙏

[https://imgur.com/a/TzSQ2rN](https://imgur.com/a/TzSQ2rN)

Honestly, I Think My Guardian Angel Drinks is a personal, unapologetically subjective take on gastronomy. Equal parts cookbook and memoir, it takes you on a gonzo ride that barrels through life and through the kitchen, with recipes rooted in memories.

It goes against all advice on how to write a successful cookbook, but if you have enough experience in a kitchen to make you comfortable with not being told exactly how much garlic to add…if you love Anthony Bourdain and hate Sandra Lee…if you have a playlist that will shuffle between Run The Jewels, Led Zeppelin, Tom Waits, Pantera, and the Bee Gees…if you get equally excited about a wine-paired meal at Le Bernardin and a brown-bagged beer with a taco truck order…if you value authenticity in both story and food, even if it comes with some dirt under its fingernails…if you’re as much a passionate reader as you are a passionate eater, and don’t want to eat, drink, or read what is bland…then you’ll appreciate this book for all the things it’s not.

In an industry riddled with cookbooks that are nothing more than “meet the new boss, same as the old boss,” Honestly… is an iconoclast.

It's a fantasy story about what happens after war ends and those who only know how to fight try and find peace.

Description:

The war is over, and good has triumphed. The demon lord is slain, and his horrific armies of monsters, demons and worse scattered to the winds by the united armies of the world. Humanity, long beleaguered by the invading armies he unleashed upon their nations has begun to rebuild and restore their destroyed world.  
But not every demon is dead. Jan’alai, the raging inferno and one of the demon lord’s most powerful generals, has outlived her cruel lord. Freed from his control, she leads a lonely existence as a hermit, deep in the dark forests where humanity has not yet reached. She is tired of fighting, and with the voice in her head long since silent, the demon of flame and ruin lacks purpose. Then, one day, a young noble’s daughter lost in the woods stumbles across her cave.  
The fearless Emma Ashkern drags the powerful yet aimless and battle-weary demon out into the world of a resurgent humanity, where Jan’alai is forced to come to terms with the chaotic, strange and illogical nature of a society not ruled by the singular will of the demon lord, as well as her own monstrous nature as she tries to find her peace with humanity and develop her friendship with the little human girl.

What makes small-town horror/mystery settings (like in Stephen King or Stranger Things) so effective?,"Hey everyone,
Thinking about the topic: What really makes those small-town horror/mystery settings, like the ones Stephen King creates or we see in shows like Stranger Things, so effective and compelling?
I was pondering this a lot while writing my own novel, 'Project Silent Wire: Summer's End', which is heavily inspired by that 80s-90s King/Stranger Things vibe. For me, one of the biggest challenges was balancing the cozy, almost nostalgic small-town feel – the familiarity, the local spots, the sense that everyone knows each other – with genuine, escalating dread as things start to go wrong beneath the surface. It's tricky to make the ordinary turn terrifying without losing the initial charm that grounds the story.
How do you all feel about this? What specific elements do you think are key to making these settings work so well and pull you in? Is it the isolation, the hidden secrets, the contrast between normal life and the encroaching darkness? Would love to hear your thoughts!
If anyone's curious about my take on this vibe, the book I mentioned is 'Project Silent Wire: Summer's End' - more info at projectsilentwire.com

I'm excited to share that I’ve recently self-published my debut novel, **The Simplest Gift** — a quiet, emotional, character-driven story of healing, intimacy, and personal transformation.

It follows Marcus, a former mercenary commander who, after a devastating injury, finds himself in the care of a young couple living a peaceful life far from the rest of the world. What begins as physical recovery slowly becomes a deeper, unexpected bond between the three of them.

It’s soft, slow, and grounded, focused on connection and internal change. The story is complete at around 55,000 words (roughly a short novel).  
  
I started writing this nearly a decade ago because I really liked the story I was building in my mind, every night before going to bed. (Some sort of personal fantasy)  
Then I just forgot about it.

 Excerpt from “HOUSE OF GUILT”

\>  I knew the house was wrong the moment we turned into the driveway, but I said nothing. The weight of Sarah's hopeful glances and the children's excited chatter pressed against my chest, an uncomfortable heat that I recognized as guilt. 



We needed this to work. After everything that had happened in the city, the foreclosure, Emily's episodes—we needed a fresh start. So I swallowed the warning that rose in my throat like bile and smiled at my family as we stepped out of the car and into our new beginning.



The house stood three stories tall, its Victorian facades weathered by decades of harsh winters. Too good to be true, the realtor had said, unable to keep the surprise from her voice when we accepted the offer without haggling. Now, watching Sarah twirl in the overgrown front yard with our youngest, Lily, I almost convinced myself that I was being paranoid.



""Dad, can I pick my room first?"" Twelve-year-old Thomas tugged at my sleeve, his eyes bright with an excitement I hadn't seen since before the bankruptcy.



""Sure, buddy,"" I said, ruffling his hair. ""Just stay on the second floor for now. We'll check out the attic spaces later.""



I didn't mention the basement. Something primitive within me wanted to board it up, pretend it didn't exist. But that was ridiculous. Houses have basements. They're just rooms beneath the ground.



The first night passed without incident. The movers wouldn't arrive until the following day with our meager possessions, so we camped out in sleeping bags in the living room, the children whispering ghost stories until Sarah shushed them with a strained laugh.



""No need to scare yourselves silly,"" she said, her eyes meeting mine over the children's heads. ""This is our home now.""



I nodded, though my gaze kept drifting to the door in the kitchen—the door that led downstairs. I'd opened it earlier while exploring, and the damp smell that rushed up had made me recoil. Just old house smell, I'd told myself, closing the door firmly. Nothing to worry about.



I woke at 3:17 AM, according to my watch. The living room was silent save for the soft breathing of my family. Yet something had woken me. A sound. Like fingernails dragging slowly across wood. I sat up, listening.



Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.



It was coming from beneath us.



""Water pipes,"" I murmured to myself. ""Old houses make noise."" But I didn't fall back asleep, and when dawn finally broke, I noticed the dark circles under Sarah's eyes that told me she'd been awake too.



The movers came and went. We unpacked. We arranged furniture. We hung photos of happier times on walls that seemed to absorb rather than reflect the light. And all the while, I avoided the basement door.



On the third night, Emily, our ten-year-old, woke us all with her screaming.



""There's someone in my room!"" she shrieked as Sarah and I rushed in. ""Something was watching me from the corner!""



I checked every inch of her bedroom while Sarah held our trembling daughter. Nothing. Just shadows and dust and the strange acoustics of an unfamiliar house.



""It was just a nightmare, Em,"" I said, smoothing her hair. ""Remember how Dr. Levinson said you might have them for a while after—"" I stopped, not wanting to mention the incident that had led to her therapy sessions.



Emily shook her head violently. ""It wasn't a dream. It was black and tall and skinny, and it had too many fingers.""



Sarah shot me a worried look over Emily's head. ""Maybe she should sleep with us tonight.""



I nodded, though a voice in my head whispered that bringing Emily to our room would only spread whatever had frightened her.



The next morning, Thomas discovered the dumbwaiter—a narrow wooden compartment that ran from the kitchen to the upstairs bedrooms, a relic from the house's earlier days. The children were fascinated, sending notes up and down to each other until Sarah, unpacking dishes in the kitchen, screamed.



I ran in to find her staring at a scrap of paper that had emerged from the dumbwaiter.



""What is it?"" I asked, taking it from her trembling hands. The paper contained a single word in childish scrawl: HUNGRY.



""The kids,"" Sarah whispered. ""They're playing tricks.""



But when questioned, both Thomas and Emily denied writing the note, and Lily was too young to have formed such neat letters.



""It's probably from the previous owners,"" I said firmly. ""Must have been stuck in the mechanism.""



That night, I heard it again. Scratch. Scratch. Scratch. Followed by a soft thump that seemed to move from one end of the basement to the other.



In the morning, Emily refused to come downstairs for breakfast. She sat at the top of the stairs, knees pulled to her chest.



""The basement man doesn't want us here,"" she said when I tried to coax her down. ""He told me in my dream.""



Sarah's hands shook as she poured cereal for Lily. ""Tom, I think maybe we should have someone look at the basement. For, you know, structural issues.""



""There's nothing wrong with the basement,"" I snapped, then immediately regretted my tone. ""I'll check it out today.""



But I didn't. Instead, I spent the day installing new locks on all the bedroom doors, telling myself it was a standard safety precaution in an old house.



That night, the scratching was louder. I lay in bed, Sarah's back to me, and listened as it transformed from random noise into a pattern. Three quick scratches, pause, three quick scratches. Like someone sending a message.



""Do you hear that?"" Sarah whispered, and I realized she was awake.



""It's just the house settling,"" I said, but even I didn't believe it anymore.



A cry from Lily's room sent us both running. We found her standing in her crib, pointing at her closet.



""Bad,"" she kept saying. ""Bad in there.""



The closet was empty. But a small handprint—too large to be Lily's, too small to be an adult's—marked the inside of the door.



""Thomas,"" Sarah said, though her voice wavered with doubt. ""He's playing pranks.""



But Thomas, when roused from sleep, was genuinely confused, his fear too real to be feigned.



The next day, I found Sarah researching the house's history on her laptop.



""There's nothing,"" she said, frustration etching lines around her mouth. ""No tragic deaths, no mysterious disappearances. The last owners were an elderly couple who moved to Florida.""



""See? Nothing to worry about."" I placed a hand on her shoulder, ignoring the chill that ran through me.



After dinner, while Sarah bathed Lily, Emily approached me, her face solemn.



""Daddy, the thing in the basement is getting hungrier,"" she said.



A cold sweat broke out across my forehead. ""There's nothing in the basement, Em.""



Her small hand found mine. ""Then why won't you go down there?""



I had no answer.



That night, I woke to find Sarah's side of the bed empty. The digital clock read 2:43 AM. I called her name softly, then with increasing volume as panic set in. The house responded with silence.



I checked the children's rooms—all asleep, though Emily's face was twisted in discomfort—before making my way downstairs. The kitchen was empty, but the basement door stood ajar, a thin line of darkness beckoning.



""Sarah?"" I called, pushing the door wider.



No response.

"I wrote a memoir about surviving abuse, war, addiction, and finding peace through diving. It comes out in 5 days.","Hey everyone,

After nearly four decades of surviving some of the darkest experiences a person can live through—childhood abuse, a war deployment, addiction, betrayal—I finally wrote the book I always knew I had in me. It's raw. It's real. And it doesn't shy away from anything.

The Count of Monte Cristi is my memoir, and it drops in 5 days. It's a story of being adopted into the home of a narcissist and abuser, serving 10 years in the U.S. Air Force—including medevac missions and deployments—then falling into addiction and crawling my way out through therapy, diving, and rediscovering purpose.

I’ve spent months pouring my heart into this, and it's terrifying and exhilarating to put it out there. I didn’t write this for fame or sympathy—I wrote it for people like me who weren’t supposed to make it. And for the ones who didn’t.

If you want to take a look when it launches, I’d be honored. I’ll post a link once it’s live.

"Our first recipe book for beginner Fermenters! ""Glow up Your Gut: Beginner Fermenation Recipes in 30 Minutes of Prep""","Glow up Your Gut: Beginner Fermentation Recipes in 30 Minutes of Prep

Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7LPVDQW
https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0F7LPVDQW

Price: £1.99 or $2.99 (USD) and available on kindle unlimited.

Hey everyone! We just released our new recipe book ""Glow Up Your Gut: Beginner Fermentation Recipes in 30 Minutes of Prep"" which is packed with beginner-friendly fermentation recipes that take just 30 minutes of prep time. Whether you're curious about kimchi, quick pickles, or probiotic drinks, this book makes gut health approachable and fun, even if you've never fermented anything before.

The idea behind the book was we found that a lot of the beginner fermentation books were quite intimidating with advanced fermentation techniques. We've really simplified it and it gives people a roadmap to start right away.

We've included a wide range of fermented probiotic rich foods, lacto-fermented vegetables, probiotic sodas with a ginger bug, flatbreads (fermented with Kefir instead of a sourdough starter, we feel a sourdough starter is a difficult technique for beginners and kefir once fermented with the dough for 8-24 hours does breakdown the gluten too albeit not as much and also gives it that sour tang that everyone loves!) we have included fermented oats for your breakfasts, condiments and snacks too!

Writing this book was a massive learning experience for us. We really dove deep into fermentation research, spent months testing recipes in our kitchen, and even taught ourselves food photography to make everything feel fresh and doable. We feel this makes the book stand out in the recipe book world where a lot of self publishers are producing books without any images at all or stock images. 

We’ve put a lot of heart into it, and we hope it helps others discover how easy and rewarding home fermentation can be and improve their gut health.

Would love any feedback or questions, and thanks for letting us share!

All the best

Drunk and Bloody,"
Grim, filthy, and unrepentantly horny, this standalone tale blends high magic with gutter violence and bathhouse politics, where everyone’s lying, everyone's spicy, and absolutely no one is getting out clean.

A quick glimpse into the world of the Freebooters, the storied millennia old mercenary company. In an effort to attract some readers to this series, this short story, around 12,000 words is about everyone's favorite drunken magus: Brannon.

Drunk and Bloody is a darkly comic plunge into the underbelly of Imperial City, where magic is sold, debts are blood-bound, and betrayal comes with a smile. Brannon, a sardonic fourth-rank magus with more debt than sense, takes one last job for the Society of Intervention: rob an old bookseller with a dangerous past and steal a handful of cursed trinkets. Easy coin, until it's not.
Caught between pleasure-crazed assassins, double-crossing courtesans, and an artifact that makes moondust look like tea leaves, Brannon must claw his way out using only wit, spite, and an alarming tolerance for pain.

Children's sports book - Bukayo the Wonderkid,"Hi all. I just made my first ever children's book with slight superhero and primarly sports theme called Bukayo the Wonderkid. 

Story is for young kids from age of 2-3 YO toward maybe 7-8 YO and it is mostly about growing up and working hard in world of soccer/football. There will be a heartwarming message for parents that push their kids into world of sports and for kids that having talent isn't enough and that you should work hard if you want something. Initially intended for my nephews but I am considering making it a 10 book series, so here is Book 1 that has 20-24 pages (there are 4 page colouring book add-ons on Etsy) and is now available on Etsy and Amazon. Paperback version will also come out later this month after I figure out all Amazon requirements and adjust it. Also suggest pricing if you can. There is also a sample to download on Amazon and you can read it without paying if you have Kindle Unlimited.

Rise of the Lark - free next 2 days,"Rise of the Lark

NEW RELEASE ❤️FREE❤️ FOR THE NEXT 5 DAYS

Epic Fantasy ⚔️ Adventure. ⚔️ Swords and Sorcery.  ⚔️ A touch of Grimdark ⚔️ Romance

Jael Lyonheart and Genna the Lark walked away from the Freebooters, from a life of blood and contracts, to forge something different: a knighthood that serves no lord, no king, only justice. But building an order from nothing is no easy feat. With only a handful of loyal companions, Lucius, a scholar-magus with a righteous heart; Bassion, a quiet killer seeking redemption; Rema, a slaver-turned-squire paying her penance; and Gaulhammer, an orc who has never known true freedom, Jael and Genna set out to carve their own place in the world.

Their first steps take them to Sela, the smaller cousin to the Freeport of Braid, a city of merchants, wayfarers, and opportunity. A lost heirloom. A child rescued from slaughter. A powerful magnate who needs their blades to stand against corruption. With each deed, the Order of the Lark begins to take shape, not just in name, but in purpose.

But even as they swear their oaths and build their code, the past is never far behind. Jael cannot forget the Freebooters, nor the man who was once his brother but chose the path of cruelty. Genna carries the weight of her own scars, of chains she broke but can never forget. And the question remains, can a band of warriors truly change the world, or will the world change them first?

Rise of the Lark picks up after Freebooters 10: A Parting of Blades and launches a new standalone series in the World of Espa. For those who have followed the Freebooters’ journey, this is the next step: the founding of a knighthood that answers only to its own principles. For new readers, this is where a new legend begins.

After 5 long months of hard work, my first novel is live on Amazon for people to buy!

I want to share my debut, a 243-page long book I wrote, edited, designed, formatted and published at the age of 12 years old.

It follows a woman named Emma Green after she moves back into her childhood home in New England, an estranged detective named Michael Gray consumed by guilt after his mother's death and the strange case of 2 murders that took place in that very same house a few weeks earlier. Green Drive follows a split timeline, swapping back and forth between 2015 and 1820 to uncover the farm's origins and how it is impacting their descendants in the modern day.

Green Drive is a tale of grief, unresolved trauma and the horrific weight of legacy and generational abuse. I was influenced by books like 'The Shining', 'The Haunting of Hill House' and 'The Woman In Black'.

"I wrote ""Zenith Man: Death, Love, and Redemption in a Georgia Courtroom,"" a memoir about defending a reclusive man accused of murdering his wife, only to discover decades later that he was autistic. AMA link inside.","Hi r/WroteABook — I’m McCracken Poston Jr., a criminal defense attorney in Georgia, and I just published my first book, *Zenith Man: Death, Love, and Redemption in a Georgia Courtroom* (Citadel, 2024).

It tells the true story of my client Alvin Ridley, a man feared as a ""bogeyman"" in our small Southern town — until one day he reported that his wife had ""stopped breathing."" Nobody around knew that he had a wife! He was accused of keeping her captive for 30 years and murdering her. But as I got deeper into the case, I discovered something far stranger — and more tragic — than the headlines suggested.

Virginia Ridley had epilepsy, agoraphobia, and, as we learned just before Alvin's trial, hypergraphia — she had written thousands of pages of her daily life during their life together, all hidden away. Those writings helped me prove Alvin's innocence. But it wasn’t until 22 years later that the truth about Alvin emerged: he was autistic. That diagnosis lifted Alvin and changed how the community saw him. For the last years of his life, he felt love and affection from his hometown for the first time ever.

This case changed my life, and I’ve written the book as both a courtroom memoir and a meditation on misunderstanding, neurodivergence, and redemption.

"Wrote a book disguised as a parenting guide—really, it’s a scream from someone raised “the wrong way”","Hi everyone,

I just finished and self-published my book, and wanted to share with folks who get the struggle of putting your guts on a page.

It’s called [Bad Parenting 101: How to Raise a Child if You Want Him Not to Succeed, Be Confused, Suffer and Lost.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7RVCB3Z)

It’s not a real guide, obviously. It’s satire—a fake manual built from real pain.

I wrote it because so much of what we call “normal parenting” is actually emotional chaos. This book pokes fun at that, but also holds a mirror up to the stuff we carry into adulthood. Think:

* emotional manipulation
* praise only when convenient
* silence when we needed support

It’s dark, sarcastic, but honest.

I recently released a book that’s close to my heart: Winning the Game: Master Your Potential, Lead with Purpose, and Love the Process: [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Winning-Game-Potential-Purpose-Process/dp/1915449901](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Winning-Game-Potential-Purpose-Process/dp/1915449901)

It’s written for anyone who’s ever felt stuck chasing traditional ideas of success—and wants to redefine it on their own terms. It blends mindset, strategy, and life lessons through the metaphor of treating life like a game.

If you enjoy books that mix personal growth with real-world application, I’d be so grateful if you gave it a read—and even more so if you felt inspired to leave a review on Goodreads or Amazon. 🙏

Would love to hear your thoughts on it or connect with others reading in the same space!",1,0,2025-05-09,Organic_Status_405,Non-Fiction,1.0

"Free Sample Chapters – Birth of Chaos [Dark Fantasy, Epic, Political","https://imgur.com/a/73vKece

Hi folks!

I’m Victor de Almeida, and I’ve just released the three free sample chapters of my debut dark fantasy novel, Birth of Chaos, a sprawling, character-driven epic set in a crumbling empire where the gods have fallen silent and the Church controls both faith and magic.


If you enjoy political intrigue, layered worldbuilding, religious tension, and characters who toe the line between duty and damnation, I’d love for you to check it out.

The sample (in EPUB format) includes the opening chapters—introducing Callahan, a street orphan touched by death and prophecy, and Trell, an Imperial Viceroy with too many secrets.

Read it free here via BookFunnel: https://dl.bookfunnel.com/s41w4p9192 

I’ll be releasing another sample of the first 100 pages in the next week or so, so do sign up to receive once I do!


The full novel launches on 6th July 2025, but I’d love to hear what you think of the opening. Feel free to DM or drop comments—I’m always keen to talk books, worldbuilding, and indie writing.

Thanks for reading, and may the Archangels guide you.
(Victor)

Iromir: Black Moon. My life's work and a few things about me.,"Greetings everyone. A little bit of introduction, my name is Dimos an author from Greece still quite new with low visibility because of my country laws. I been writting since the age of 14 until I finally decided to start my life's project. A 5 book dark fantasy series. It took me 8 whole years to write the first book alone after a lot of struggle and minimal to none support from freinds or family but I pulled through. For your knowledge I am already almost half way through the second book.

Iromir: Black Moon. The first in the series. Its an epic tale I have poured my very being within and gave a part of my soul to each and every one of my characters good or bad to bring them to life. Fast paced with no unnecessary descriptions and quite often straight to the point. I decided to go agaisnt the usual tropes and the FMC is destined to destroy the world of Iromir no matter what she does.

Blurb: ""Even if they didn't know it now, in their darkest moments, someone had to fight through the void and break free of the chains of horror and despair. Someone to create the spark, and lead them to the other side. One who would make the greatest sacrifices. One who would lead them through uncharted waters, deep in a sea of harrowed souls under a starless, wounded sky. That someone, had to be a now frail girl answering also to a name given by a sick and twisted prophecy. Omega.""

 Ai'nil always knew that her parents were hiding something from her. And it had to do with the strange mark she had on her body. She could have never imagined what it would actually mean and the journey she was about to embark on. With two companions following along, she tries to figure out who she is and what she's destined for.

 Epic fantasy. Grimdark, and elements of Dark Fantasy. Romance and occasional spice. Deep characters and long plot arcs. Mercenaries. Welcome to the Freebooters.

With Jael gone, the Freebooters turn to Eruch as captain. As they rebuild their ranks and take on a host of new mates, something begins to shift.

The Freebooters have fought their way through worse, but this time, the enemy is not just ahead of them—it’s within.

New allies. Old grudges. A road paved in blood.

The noose is tightening.

A tale of war, loyalty, and the price of survival, Freebooters XI: Bitter Road takes the legendary company to the edge of their greatest battle yet. Told from the perspectives of Eruch, Lincoln and Andri.

"Poetry for Anyone Struggling with Depression or Feeling Alone – 2 Books Done, 1 in Progress","I have completed two poetry books and am working on a third. Both are very centered around struggle, depression, self-worth and working through those. If you feel like you are alone, or feel like you can't express or communicate these feelings, this was what I was hoping to be able to hit on. 

""half a story"" is the first book, finished it March 2020 (shut down gave us a ton of time to wrap it up). This book was built on the idea that as the narrator of the story, you only get my half, and through heartbreak, depression and abuse, there is still another perspective out there on how they'd view the narrator.

The Komodo monitor – gluttonous, ravenous, cannibalistic – top predator on an isolated cluster of tropical islands.  
  
When the ragged group of castaways stagger ashore, they think they are saved.  
  
Instead they find themselves prey.  
  
But they are not alone in this lost world – and dragons are not the only predators.  
  
Reptilian savagery gives way to human nature – primal instinct becomes betrayal and murder – and they will all soon learn that sins of the past are never truly buried.  
  
But the lost world knows no judgment – and survival knows no sin.  
  
The dragons wait for them all.

The Book of Traitors,"The Book of Traitors
Espa Chronicle book 8

The Book of Traitors is the riveting eighth chapter in The Espa Chronicle, an epic fantasy saga chronicling the rise and fall of the Raakonian Empire.

Janus, the fledgling prince, has escaped across the sea to a land ruled by gladiators and pirates, with his deadly sister Cirilla ever at his side. Cyrus Honadel, shattered in mind and consumed by a burning rage, arrives in the same distant land, marked a traitor in his own right.

Both men are pursued relentlessly. Cyrus is hunted by William Honadel, the son of Pollux, driven by vengeance to avenge his father’s death. Janus is stalked by Andri Vacul, the assassin and hand of Illyania, dispatched to finally put an end to the elusive and despised White Prince.

As these hunted men tread foreign soil, the web of betrayal tightens, and the consequences of their choices begin to close in around them, leaving them nowhere to hide.

This book is set concurrently with many of the events of Book nine of The Espa Chronicle: Valhelm, The Dragon.

[Novel] Error Code: Love (Sci-Fi Noir / Cyberpunk / Slow-Burn Romance),"I’ve never done this before — finished a book, let alone put it out into the world. But it’s real now. It's called Error Code: Love, and it’s been live on Kindle for a few days.

It’s about a detective who doesn’t trust machines, and an android partner who wasn’t programmed to feel anything. They’re forced to work together, and things start... slipping. The system. Her code. Him.

What I thought would be a cyberpunk murder mystery turned into something slower, stranger, and honestly way more personal than I expected.

I checked my dashboard this morning. Someone finished the book. Then they went back and started rereading it. Got so hyped up that I wrote a post about it and everything went wild from there. 

That hit me harder than any sale ever could. (Or so I thought)

If slow-burns, broken people, and quiet tension are your thing — maybe you’ll get something out of it too. It’s on Kindle and KU if you’re curious. (Direct links are on my profile).

 And if you’re not, thanks for just reading this far.

*…Imagine how it was before Netherfield is let.*

‘Intrigue At Longbourn’ is probably the most authentic ‘Pride & Prejudice’ derivative you will ever read.

Elizabeth Bennet enjoys a lively six months before Netherfield Park is let at last. She is appalled to learn that a pregnant teenage kitchen maid, Alice, was dismissed from Longbourn House eight or nine years earlier with no thought for her welfare or that of her unborn child.

Unable to involve her family on the occasion, she approaches the recently arrived, handsome, young rector of Longbourn parish, Mr Wilde, and he agrees to assist her in secret. Their apparently clandestine association is noticed and misinterpreted by some.

Meanwhile, to secure the family’s future, Mr Bennet embarks on a complicated, high-risk scheme which is ultimately in danger of spiralling out of control.

Holidays provide welcome diversions and the social scene is enhanced by a young scientist named Julius Fairweather. 

Nevertheless, father’s and daughter’s separate manoeuvres inevitably clash, stoked up by a jealous mischief-maker, as the summer races inexorably towards Michaelmas of 1797 when a young man of large fortune named Bingley first enters the neighbourhood.

My first book became a story I had to share,"Hi everyone,
I’m just starting my journey as a writer. My first fantasy novel was published in Finnish on Amazon ""Varjot Ylvägardin yllä""— it was the first time I ever dared to share my world with others.

But I wanted to go further.
I turned that story into something new: a visual experience on Steam - ""Black Equation"".
It’s not a game in the usual sense — no choices, no battles. Just a full story in 29 chapters, with art, music, and emotion.

I even wrote poems for it and used AI to help bring them to life as songs — they became the soundtrack.

Everything here is new for me — writing, publishing, even learning to speak through art. But I wanted to try. And maybe someone out there will hear it.

Thanks for reading.",3,5,2025-05-05,AlexVuorenmaan,Adult - Fantasy,1.0
Privatized Freedom - Nordic Cyberpunk Satire - Available (almost) Everywhere,"[Cover Image](https://i.imgur.com/R8hP2U9.jpeg)

***In the frozen heart of Svalbard, the future is privately owned.***

​Ashton Frey is a washed-up private investigator with a burned-out neural implant and a job he should’ve walked away from. Now he’s chasing a corporate conspiracy from the gutters of Helsinki to the permafrost of the Arctic north. Haunted by his past, hunted by kill teams, and carrying an ego-maniacal AI in his head that won’t shut up.

​Privatized Freedom is a gritty Nordic cyberpunk thriller soaked in corporate absurdity and razor-edged satire, where AIs are in therapy, assassins offer customer satisfaction surveys, and rebellion comes with a subscription fee.

***Equal parts high-velocity action and dark comedy, it’s a savage ride through a future that’s already been bought and sold.***

The Book of the Universal Justice Age: The Assassination of Princess Diana & the Rise of Collective Truth,"***""The truth was never lost — it was buried.""***

 

This groundbreaking exposé blends forensic investigation, spiritual insight, and historical analysis to uncover the hidden network of power behind the death of Princess Diana. More than a tragedy, her assassination marked a turning point — a signal of a system willing to silence even the most beloved voices to protect its secrets.

Through decoded intelligence patterns, suppressed testimonies, and channelled soul insights, this book reveals the shocking orchestration of events surrounding Diana's crash in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel. But this is not just about one woman — it's about centuries of hidden history finally surfacing.

 

Inside this book:

* The **MI6 & MI5 covert operations** that have shaped major British coverups — from Diana to Madeleine McCann, from Jill Dando to the Moors Murders.
* The **Scotts family's erased royal lineage**, spiritually linked to Mary, Queen of Scots — and the ongoing surveillance and suppression they've endured across generations.
* A deep forensic reading of song lyrics like ""Red Ruby Da Sleaze"" and ""Princess Diana,"" revealing symbolic clues and intelligence references hidden in plain sight.
* The truth behind the deaths of **Amy Winehouse, Stephen Lawrence, and other public figures**, who carried light and disruption into a system of shadows.
* The roles of **Sir Richard Dearlove** (former Chief of MI6, government name: Richard Billing Dearlove) and **Sir Richard Moore** (current Chief, government name: Richard Peter Moore) in perpetuating silence and control.

 

A fusion of multidimensional knowledge, public record, and psychic transmission, this book does what the establishment fears most: it names names, reveals patterns, and uplifts the souls they tried to bury.

Because the age of universal justice is no longer coming —
