Value Add ideas for live events?,"Quick background--I am a Pagan kids' author. I've done well at Pagan events and festivals, but I am considering vending at a renaissance faire. 

In addition to books, I also sell a few stickers and plushies at my table. But I am trying to think of something else I could offer for non-Pagan folks at a ren faire. 🤔 I have face painting experience and considered this--but that can become a HUGE time-suck at public events.

The Ones You Lose by Witney Russell (Contemporary Romance - Kindle Unlimited),"The Ones You Lose by Witney Russell is an absolute rollercoaster of emotions that had me hooked from start to finish. This epic love story has it all: multiple love interests, a suit daddy, a tattooed baddie, tragic backstories, and ride or die friendships. While it incorporates romance tropes, it does so in a way that feels fresh and original, avoiding the pitfalls of feeling cliché.

What sets this book apart is its ability to balance steamy and spicy romance with genuine emotion and depth. The chemistry between the characters is electric, and the love scenes are enough to make any romance reader swoon. But beyond the passion, there's also a heart-wrenching emotional depth that left me in tears.

Olivia Morgan's story is one that will stick with me for a long time. Her journey of love, loss, and self-discovery is beautifully written and incredibly relatable. The supporting characters are equally well-developed, and their relationships with Olivia add layers of complexity to the story.

KDP Global Fund Payout Update from Written Word Media,"Hi everyone!

I just wanted to share the latest Amazon KDP Global Fund Payout data with you all.

Every month, Amazon announces the size of the previous month’s Kindle Direct Publishing Global Fund. This is the pot of money that authors whose titles are available through Kindle Unlimited get paid out of. In this post, we keep a running list of the fund sizes, so we can see how it’s changed over time.

We also keep track of the KDP Per Page Payout to make it easier for you to keep track of roughly how much authors earn per page read for Kindle Unlimited titles.

Instagram marketing question,"I have published my first novel and working through my second. I am also an artist so I can draw and design art for promoting my book, but I also like everyone have a job, family,  etc.. so time is limited.

My question to the group is about using AI to generate art to use as Instagram reels to promote my book. I see tons of reels where people use free images and such they did not take to promote thier books. What are your thoughts on this.

I write classic cyberpunk novels and Short stories so I can't just use pretty landscapes and cups of coffee images you find online.

Also as an artist I do not mind AI art as long as it is attributed properly. I find AI images for drawing or painting references no different then digging through magazines, in some ways better because you are not copying off someone else's creativity.

Didn't do ARCs,"Hello everyone! So, I did this whole publishing thing backward. I published my debut in March 2023 and the first sequel in September 2023. I have a third set to release in April 2024. I never looked for ARC readers, never got reviews pre-publication, and it's really hurt me. I've learned my lesson, BUT I can't build time into my schedule for the release of the fourth and final book in the series to collect ARCs after editing, so I'm kind of retroactively gathering reviews through BookFunnel for all the books. I have an idea for a new series that I will begin releasing next year, but I will plan it out much better in terms of getting reviews and starting out on the right foot.

All of this said, I want to know I'm not alone in failing to get reviews early in the process. Has anyone else just completely screwed up and found that their first year of royalties is a whopping $300? What suggestions might you have for getting it right for the next series (other than the obvious, you need to build in a cushion of time before publishing to collect reviews)? And what would you call reviews that you collect after publication?

I did the impossible,"I'm thrilled to share that my book, ""Fertility Wheel,"" is currently available for free on Amazon for two of its five free days: today and the 22nd. Despite originally planning for five days, I couldn't wait to offer this opportunity to the world!  
  
Hello to all readers and fellow authors, it has been a five-year journey to create this book. Please take advantage of its free download from February 20-22. I invite you to delve into my non-fiction work and, if possible, leave a rating. Drawing from my background in farming and agriculture, I've unlocked a new perspective on the zodiac symbols that will forever change how you see them.  
  
Explore the depths of ""Fertility Wheel,"" where the zodiac symbols are reimagined as simplified pictograms embodying the essence of fertility, agriculture, and survival. These symbols encapsulate the essence of raising animals, cultivating crops, and understanding ancient seasonal cycles and risks. This fresh interpretation offers a grounded perspective, linking the celestial with essential elements of earthly survival and agricultural heritage.  
  
Through seamless integration of agriculture, religion, mythology, astronomy, history, and spirituality, I've crafted a comprehensive yet accessible book.  
  
Prepare for a paradigm shift as you discover how the zodiac, when aligned properly, transforms into a timeless oracle of farming—a Fertility Wheel or agricultural almanac. This tool may have guided humanity for centuries before it was relegated to fortune-telling. Within these pages, you'll gain insight into the workings of the Fertility Wheel and its practical applications.  
  
Witness the profound metamorphosis as the zodiac symbols align with the Sun, evolving from mere signs into a practical agricultural almanac. This guide, meticulously designed for ancient farmers, nomads, or shepherds, departs from traditional astrological norms to pioneer Fertility Wheel Astrology.  
  
My research unveils a guide that aligns with the Earth's natural cycles rather than individual destinies. Fertility Wheel Astrology is a departure from traditional astrological norms, offering invaluable insights into optimal farming practices.  
  
The book introduces a fresh perspective on the Chinese zodiac, reordering the animals into a fertility wheel. Explore the agricultural elements embedded in ancient art and narratives, shedding new light on the tools held by Hindu deities, which serve as implements for tending the land.  
  
Throughout these pages, expect to have your perceptions of ancient texts and pictograms challenged and reshaped. Delve into a transformative journey that questions the true meaning of these symbols, lifting the veil on their genuine nature.  
  
Farming lies at the core of survival, and this exploration goes beyond surface-level predictions, delving into the profound impact of these symbols on diverse cultures.  
  
My work combines computers, crop calendars, and fundamental farming knowledge to present unique ideas and revelations. Rooted in genuine efforts and tangible information, this book challenges conventional wisdom and seeks to uncover the truth behind ancient symbols.  
  
I'm immensely proud of this work, and it's crucial to me that its message remains unaltered. Thank you for joining me on this journey of discovery and enlightenment.

Seeking guidance from more experienced authors,"Hey everyone, I need some advice.

Since publishing in June, my fantasy novel has received around 200 reviews, particularly from Advance Reader Copies (ARCs), on platforms such as Amazon and Goodreads (Combined; 43 on Amazon and 155 on Goodreads).

While the reception has been good, I don't know how to market the book. It's the first of a trilogy and my debut one.

In order to boost visibility, I reached out to my TikTok followers, offering complimentary copies.

I've engaged with those having Kindle Unlimited subscriptions, asking them, through a video plot of the novel and a snippet, if that could be up their alley.

If they said, ""Yes"", I requested that readers share their experience through simple, faceless videos showcasing the book cover with a ""currently reading"" caption in order to amplify its visibility.

But the problem is that TikTok is all about romance. I don't find many Fantasy/sci-fi/dystopian readers.

What's next? I'm at a crossroads.

I can't sustain this approach forever. It is very time-consuming and hinders my ability to focus on writing the sequels.

I've only written two chapters of the sequel, but I'm planning to write one chapter a week so that in one year, it will be ready. Maybe.  
I emailed so many platforms to have a spot for author interviews (I made most of my sales on Tiktok lives). But nothing, No response.  


I paid a Fiverr promoter to optimize my keywords, categories, description, and title.

I've been thinking of running Amazon ads, but I don't know how they work, and I can't waste a lot of money. I'm not wealthy, and I don't take pride in that.

The only chance that I see is to let people know about this book's existence by word of mouth on Reddit. I noticed that people here are more my audience.

If any of you have experience or recommendations on effective indie author marketing, I would appreciate your input.

Amazon POD - Good or Bad?,"Thoughts on using Amazon print on demand (POD)?

My issue with the SPSFC 3 competition,"(Please share this with any author in the SPSFC competition. Thanx!) 

I know for a fact that certain books had gotten great reviews on NetGalley, received a book award, even had a positive editorial review. Of course authors expect negative reviews. If you can’t handle those then you’re in the wrong business I’m afraid. But in the SPSFC competition I’ve witnessed great indie books get totally demolished! To the point that any would think the authors that entered were incompetent writers. And trust me that couldn’t be farther from the truth. Man were these reviews brutal! So brutal it was like they never gave the books a chance at all. I speak on this because I’ve read two absolute gems that got slammed by the judges and I just don’t think it’s right! One review felt quite personal and just plain mean. I think that more than anything baffled me. And that’s the thing, if I’d never had read the books myself I’d of thought they sounded shit from those reviews. 

Most of the teams when handling reviews were constructive when needed, but also respectable. The Space Girl team however seem to have a real problem with the author’s allocated to them, almost forgetting that they are indie, that they are trying their damn best, that they do not have the astronomical resources of a traditionally published team. I don’t know. It just all feels in bad taste. I believe that indie books have their own flavour so to speak, and I feel that some judges see that and some do not. I know some authors feel hard done by, and have voiced their disappointment (some more unprofessionally than others) but I just want to say to those authors that while this competition is fantastic for exposure, there are many other ways for you to break through and reach the readers you want, and that way is different for you all. The opinion of a few does not count for the majority. 

But this goes for the finalists as well. If you notice your book getting all the praise in the competition - then it’s sudden radio silence afterwards, please do not be disheartened. Don’t get trapped in the competition loop. By all means enter as much as you like, but do it for the joy, not because you think you need too. I’m sorry for rambling, I just had to get this off my chest as I review books professionally, and judge in other competitions. It is for this reason I shall remain somewhat anonymous 😉I hope this comes across as positive as I intended 😂

How to Promote Myself. .,"Hello, indie authors!  
I'm June. As a university student in Korea, I write journals, stories, and dream of becoming a famous author someday.  
While writing skills are important, I've realized that promoting myself is just as crucial.   
So, I contemplated how to effectively deliver my work and decided to create a simple website where my thoughts are organized.

Where To Distribute Video Cookbook Online?,"Hello:

I'm working on a cookbook featuring photos, text, some music and 15 - 20 videos. Unfortunately, it's my understanding that Amazon/Kindle do not accept multimedia books for distribution - is that correct?

Yes I could do a version without video and audio, but it takes away a big part of the appeal. And putting videos on our YouTube channel isn't the same as an all-in-one multi-media product.

So I'm inviting ideas on where & how to distribute this product with all the bells & whistles (I think Apple iBooks allow all this? I don't think their user numbers/Mac users come anywhere close to Amazon's but at least it's something?) Okay thanks up front for your help on this one.",1,1,2024-01-21,THERocknRollChef,N/A,1.0
Writer/Author Community!,"Hello everyone! I go by Agust and I consider myself to be a writer and am an author of one poetry book (so far) with a novel in progress.

Anyway, as a writer I found it so difficult to make other writer friends easily or have other writers to work with and so I wanted to make a community for all writers! 

I hope this can be a positive place where we can learn from each other and share our work. I know how special stories are to us, and sharing them with others. 

And with the uprise of self publishing, it’s so hard to reach an audience. Hopefully we can support each other in this way too. :)

Where to find other good independent writers?,"So I'm an indie author myself, been doing it about 10 years. I have my own website that I've been running for a while now, and I have one segment where I take books from small/indie authors and review them, giving honest feedback and ratings and everything.

I love doing it, because I love helping out others like me. But what I didn't anticipate was how hard it'd be to find authors to review. That's honestly been my biggest hang-up now. One of my stipulations is that I have to get permission from the author before I send a review. But I put out occasional feelers and get little response back. I think they think it's too good to be true, or that I'm gonna end up charging them or something, so they probably think I'm a scammer. And almost all writing groups I'm in don't allow self-promo, so that's not an option. I'm even reluctant to ask about it here, because I'm not sure if it'd be against the rules

Do you guys have any resources for networking/communities that'd be able to fulfill this? Reddit has changed a lot since I was pretty active on it so I'm not sure if this post is against any rules or guidelines or anything. Let me know if so; I'm not baiting or anything, I just want to find more people like me, so we can be mutually beneficial.",5,21,2024-01-03,Blucatt,N/A,1.0
Authors helping authors sell books,"Hi folks, I am wondering if you are interested in or know of other forums where authors help each other in marketing and sales of books. Not agencies or paid services but real authors.

My own experience with one such group of authors was positive in which we provided reciprocal reviews. The expectation wasn't that we will give positive review but that if we like the book each of us will give a review.  If one of us doesn't like the other book, he/she would be completely free not to provide a review - the only expectation being that you don't publish a review if you decide it's less than 4 stars.   This is a fairly standard policy/agreement even for large sites like Kirkus.

The collaboration was completely unconditional without influencing anyone's free opinion.

In another case we guest posted each others'  book review on your respective blogs.

There is absolutely no cost or expectation of payment  - nor is the expectation that someone will buy some advanced services etc. No cost period. Only real authors.

Is there an appetite for that kind of collaboration? I would love to connect with some authors who would be interested in such collaboration.",6,17,2023-12-28,coolChipmuck,N/A,1.0

Tips on what I did as a debut author to have what I see as a successful launch,"Hi! My debut fantasy book came out in January of 2023 and I just wanted to talk about some of the things I did that helped with its success.

I started advertising early. I think I started to advertise six months before its release, and that really helped hype it up. I introduced the world, the main characters, the plot, etc. to create hype on IG and overall it worked! It helped me get a lot of ARC readers, which I’ll touch on later.

COVER ARTIST. Do not skip out on a good cover. Mine was $900 and I still get compliments on it all the time. People absolutely judge a book by its cover. Make sure your cover artist knows the trends of your genre. Mine exclusively does fantasy/fantasy romance and is well known in the genre for her covers. Get a good cover. The book community on social media love showing off a beautiful cover.

ARCS. I sent out close to 150 arcs for book 1. I asked for them primarily through IG and FB and had them fill out a google form, where I made sure they read my genre. It’s very important to give your ARCs to people who read your genre, or you’re going to set up your book for failure. I had maybe 60? Reviewers actually pull through and review. That’s a great %! Expect 10% and do not interact with your reviews unless you are tagged.

Developmental editor!! I paid $3,000 for mine, but many of them offer payment plans. Readers will overlook one or two grammatical errors, but if there are developmental errors, they’re more likely to take notice. My editor was money well spent. Highly recommend developmental editing in your budget.

Never pay someone to review your book. Just don’t. You’ll get a lot of DMs over people asking. Don’t do it. Same with differing services. Legit services won’t reach out to you.

Play to your books strengths. Mine is based on a d&d campaign. So I leaned heavily into that and a lot of my readers are players themselves. Use tropes. They’re easy to talk about. Pick your favorite quotes and use them.

Give yourself more time than you think you need. Learning everything for the first time means something is going to go wrong. I just published my 2nd book and something still went wrong. It’s okay! We’re learning. But make sure to plan for enough time to avoid stress.

Make friends with other indie authors in your genre!! Networking is so so important.

There was more, but I can think of them right now. Feel free to ask questions!",7,11,2023-12-13,Plastic_Glove3752,N/A,0.9

Searching for Beta Readers,"I'm nearing the end of my first draft and working on the second draft for what's already written, so, I'm going to need some beta readers before I get into the final draft.

Title:

* Vepuei and the Blindness

Word Count:

* 143888

Please note: page count is an estimate based on the average word count/page x (pages written + estimated pages to go) and may vary in the final piece.

Summary:

In the year 6017 of the Galactic Era, a royal family crash landed deep into enemy territory outside a Sölïän Enclave planet that exists within the heart of a Tembren Peace Alliance zone. Despite the TPA zone existing in the belly of the Fire Kingdom's territory, regulations were in place by the Tembren Peace Alliance which meant that they were not authorized to bring about any acts of war on the imperial family. Instead, the Fire Kingdom offered peace and liberation from the family's oppressors, the Shadow Empire government. The price, should they accept the terms? 100% of the Shadow Empire territory.

The alliance was to be formed when Prince Alessandro Ombra of the Shadow Empire came to age at 13 years old. He is to wed Daylight Ōm'Bïsk of the Fire Kingdom, bringing forth the formation of a powerful alliance and an end to a 6000-year-old war. The offering of peace, however, was an illusion to keep the royal family content with the risky citizenship they had under the Fire Kingdom. Once King Helähf Ōm'Bïsk was certain that he'd had the trust and loyalty of the royal Shadow family, he ransomed the family back to the Shadow Empire, their oppressors. Now, the last of the royal bloodline face persecution in their homeland.

Content Warnings:

* Grooming
* Incest
* Substance Abuse
* Suicidal Ideation

Timeline:

* The beta draft should be ready in 1-2 years.
* The deadline will be six months after the release of the beta draft.

Are All Easy Read Books for Kids?,"Are all easy read books for kid? NO. In fact, 50 Shades was considered  ‘easy read’ by some ppl but it has adult content in it.

Occasionally , I write fanfic, but my fanfic is meant for 18 & over.

First book finally out!,"Well, it's only taken about 13 years, but I finally released my first book. I thought I'd learned a ton about self-publishing but of course I'm making mistakes right and left. Never mind, I was prepared for that- what I guess I *wasn't* prepared for is the way I keep second-guessing myself. It's kind of hair-raising to have responsibility for absolutely *everything.* Unlike with trad publishing I'm the only one making these decisions, the only one risking any money, and every time I get less than a five star review or have a less-than-stellar marketing result I start thinking, 'Maybe I should have waited longer to release it. Should I go back and make some changes to chapter X to make my MC's reactions to event Y more clear?' I try to remind myself that this is a business that I've gotten myself into- and that requires consistent effort over a possibly long period of time- and NOT to be disrupted by abrupt changes, zigzagging and erratic starts and stops.   
Anyway, if you like to read about obscure historical events - the kind history books don't tell- check out Raise the Wind, by Sarah Shaw. It's the first of a series (all standalone) about a merchant trading company in the 18th century, set in various parts of the world. This one is set in Colonial Georgia. It's on sale now for $1.99. I hope to release the second one, set in Morocco, in Spring of next year.",3,1,2023-11-29,Old_lady_writing,N/A,1.0
Finally Broke Out of My Writer's Block,"I've been stuck on one chapter in my novel for a while now, and I'm usually able to bounce around the book to different chapters, keeping me productive, but this time, I was absolutely halted for three whole months.

I tried to push myself to complete the chapter I was on, but the words weren't flowing, and the content I did end up writing was utter nonsense. I didn't know where I was going with the chapter.

Finally, I took a break from forcing the chapter out, sat down, revisited a conceptual scene I'd started writing before it became a rambel about my relationship with my late brother. Crossed out all the rambilings and tweaked the concept work to actually make sense in my book canonically. It turned into an entire 30+ page handwritten chapter for my book. I found the chapter's place in my timeline and labeled it accordingly, and went on to write thr chapter to follow, another 30+ page handwritten work.

As I was going over the Timeline to see where the chspters fit in my story, I read over some of the keypoints in my timeline. That got me wondering about the results of the keypoints, and how I could turn those results into a full blown chapter. I started describing the consequences of the events, and low-and-behold, I wrote two more consecutive 30+ page chapters for my book on yet a different area of the timeline.

Feeling acomplished, I went back and reviewed what I had written in the current chapter. I scrached out the nonsensentical concepts I'd written down, and finally took the time to draw a map of the planet in the chapter's setting. I even added makers for key locations on the map. From there, I was able to write new chapter content with my new map as a guiding reference, eventually making it to the scene from the chapter I'd written in the psych ward. I edited the scene to flow seemlessly with the scene that came before, tweaked a few details to match the scenery from my map, and then picked up from the end of what I wrote of the scene. With my handy map, I finally knew what I wanted to do with the chapter, and the words flowed quite freely. I ended up with a 58 page handwritten chapter to add to the project's completed chapters that flow together in chronological order.

I've got a few ideas for the chapter to come, which will be the final chapter in act II, but I think I'll play around with some concepts from elsewhere in the book's timeline before I dive in, and get that writing mojo flowing.

The bound version of my rough draft is getting quite heavy, and it's already about one inch thick! I can't wait to see how the portfolio turns out once I write around the chapters fitting into other places in the timeline! It will be a spectical!

Fan of The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy? Do I have the book for you.,"I was always a fan of shows like Rick and Morty, and books like Hitchhikers Guide. Most of all I always wanted to write something like that. Then my dad died when I was 15. I decided, now's good a time as any. So I wrote, and finished the story this year.

I'm incredible proud of the book. It's funny. Sometimes horrifying. A story about a man trying to get his dog back from the hands of a violent outlaw. He soon realizes that he'll have to travel more than West. With help from the moronic bounty hunter wannabe ""The Boots of Wrath"", he travels from dimension and back again, and meets some gods. He meets Jesus, (Literally) meets some lovecraftian horrors, and hell, he even meets Santa Claus. If you could believe that.

Soap: A Novel About Anxiety and Depression,"Just over ten years ago I wrote the first draft of this novel. I really didn't like it, mainly because at the time I was still living through the subjects discussed.  
  
Just over one year ago, I returned to that first draft and began to edit.  
There's a lot in here taken from my personal experiences of anxiety, depression, and other aspects of mental health. Yet, at its core, it is still fiction.  
  
The novel is called Soap, and it tells the narrative and mystery of Noah - an anxious, neurotic and isolated young man who roams the streets of Manchester either in a haze of adrenaline or intoxication. Existing in a mode of fight or flight and haunted by his past, Noah is forced to confront himself when he falls for the beautiful and good-hearted Yasmin. Battling his alcoholism and his crippling sense of self, Noah's narrative is a story of identity, masculinity, disordered anxiety, and how the unchosen experiences of our childhood are forever present in our habitual lives as adults.  
It's available both in paperback and kindle. I hope at the very least people enjoy reading it, and I also hope that perhaps it helps anyone who is struggling themselves.

Overcoming Fears of The Known & Unknown: Through Blind Eyes (Non-Fiction),"This book is a journey through blind eyes. First, I’ll explain some of the principles and techniques I have implemented to deal with the fears that come from my blindness. Then we go on an adventure through my childhood to adult life as well as a few of the key encounters that have shaped my perceptions. Trauma, anxiety, and depression, we’ll go over how I conquer all of these things. In the end my hope is others will learn from my mistakes and triumphs while acquiring some new tools to try on the path towards their true potential.  
  
Samples:  
  
True Fear  
  
(I have a lot of sketchy hitch-hiking memories, but this next one left a lasting impression.)  
  
It was another day where I was hitch-hiking back home from Tom’s place. These were always long trips because I'd have to get rides from town to town. I got picked up relatively quickly by a nice guy, but unfortunately there was a little miscommunication when I got in. He ended up dropping me off at the bottom of a mountain right on a junction. Depending on the type junctions can be the worst place to get a ride; people don't usually want to stop on a corner. I stood at that junction for two or three hours until it started to get dark. Eventually I decided maybe I’d have better luck if I got off the main corner, so I started hiking up the mountain. After about ten minutes of walking up a beautiful mountain road people started driving by honking and screaming “THERE'S A BEAR UP THERE!”  
  
To this day I have never been so scared. Not only was it getting dark, but I’m blind and was in the middle of nowhere. There were no houses, no businesses, there was nothing but endless trees, a bear and me. After I heard those shouts, I turned around and walked back to the shitty corner. Then I stood there for another hour or so completely soaked in fear. Thankfully for some reason I wasn't meant to be dinner that night and a kind soul picked me up. His exact words were “You're lucky, I only stopped because you looked nice.”  
  
Unintentional Features  
  
I had a few brutal wipeouts on bikes. I remember one close call where I almost lost my manhood. Me and Bert were riding our bikes around a restaurant drive-thru. There was a barrier between the parking lot and the drive-thru. For some reason I thought it would look cool if I jumped over the barrier. I sucked, so I fell on my face. The crash was rough but then I stood up and saw a small circle imprinted on the road. My handlebars hit the ground so hard they ripped through both sides of my jeans, right between my legs. That was truly terrifying and an awkward bike ride home trying to hold my pants together.  
  
At some point I decided it'd be a great idea to put one smaller tire on the front of my bike. The bike looked pretty cool, riding it was very sketchy though. The first time I tried riding it I was ripping down a steep hill to a friend’s house. I wanted to show off my badass wheels. Around halfway down the hill I experienced a different form of speed wobbles. Out of nowhere the handlebars started to shake uncontrollably, then I ate shit. The gravel strategy couldn't save me on a bike, so I ended up sliding on the pavement which gave me a nasty road rash all over my arms and legs. I decided to switch back to a normal front tire after that day.  
  
I built custom pegs for my bike, then it got stolen. I got another bike; it got stolen immediately after the first one. Then I tried trick scootering and it got stolen too. That was the end of that, I just started walking everywhere.

I Just Published My First Short Story on KDP :),"Hi all :),

My name is Grace Anderson and I just published my first short story on Amazon. 

It's called The Friends We Make in the Psych Ward, I based it off my own experiences  dealing with the mental health care system as a teenager. The psych ward setting is interwoven with themes of female friendship, the stigma around mental illness and the depth of the teenage experience.

While I would really appreciate it if some of you bought my ebook,advice on how to effectively promote my work would be great too. I published something short for my first so I can experiment with various marketing and promotion tactics before I publish my bigger projects.

Debut sci-fi novella,"Hey all! My first book is coming out a week from today. 

It is post-apocalyptic cozy sci-fi, following the crew of a ship as they attempt to survive the consequences of a universal war that nearly destroyed everything. The crew of the *Circumstance* face an ending that they never wanted and have to come to terms with unexpected lost, as well as letting some dreams go that they had been fighting for throughout the war. It has nostalgia, hope, found family, and a strong desire to never give up.

Persuading Reality: Social-Psychophysiological Responses to Placebo Effects,"Hello fellow authors, this is an old essay of mine I thought others may gain some insights from:)

Persuading Reality: Social-Psychophysiological Responses to Placebo Effects

Definitions

Placebo Effect: There are multiple versions of placebo effects. This paper will use Dr. Alia Crum’s definition from behavioral health which splits the placebo effect into three components.

1. Social Context (what one learns from external sources which influence their mindsets)
2. Mindsets or Beliefs (One’s core assumptions about their subjective and objective reality which influence their expectations, adaptations, and goals)
3. Natural physiological processes in the brain and body that can produce different outcomes (the mechanisms which underpin the psychophysiological response to various stimuli)

Nocebo Effect: Negative version of a placebo effect.

Perceptual Persuasions: Beliefs and behaviors that one implements to alter their own psychophysiology.

Introduction:

One’s psychophysiology can be altered by their subjective reality. Over time the number of studies that back up this claim have continued to climb. Most of the population will go through their entire life not knowing the power of the mind-body connection. For example, if a person believes healthy food is decadent and nutritious, the food has a higher nutritional value. If an individual believes a medication is going to have adverse side-effects, there is a higher chance that it will. And if one believes stress is an opportunity for growth that enhances them instead of an insurmountable dilemma that diminishes them, their physiological responses indicate they’re correct. There are endless examples of individuals influencing their psychophysiology by changing their expectations. The mind influences outcomes across a person’s entire lifespan. Placebo effects, nocebo effects, and perceptual persuasions continue to prove that the mind-body connection is a key component of one’s overall health.

Placebo effects are one example of how the mind influences the body in miraculous ways. In a study (Mindset Matters: Exercise and the Placebo Effect, 2007) conducted by Dr. Alia Crum and Ellen Langer, they discovered that mindsets have a substantial impact on one’s health. The study divided 84 female hotel room attendants into two groups. After taking a few key physiological measurements the control group went back to work with no mindset training. The other subjects were then told about the benefits of exercise and how they were vastly exceeding the recommended daily requirements for a healthy lifestyle. After four weeks, Crum and Langer took the same measurements and discovered the women that had been simply told the truth about exercise showed a wide range of positive outcomes. This is just one example of many that have popped up over the years; studies like these show the power of placebo effects. A person’s mindset has an immediate impact on their reality. Crum has some brilliant insights about placebo effects in behavioral psychology. In a study on nutrition (Mind Over Milkshakes: Mindsets, Not Just Nutrients, Determine the Ghrelin Response, 2011), Dr. Crum, Peter Salovey, and Kelly J. Brownell told their subjects they were conducting a study on low-fat and high-fat milkshakes, but the milkshakes were the same for all tests. This allowed them to measure the ghrelin hormone response in the stomach after the subjects consumed the milkshakes (ghrelin is the hunger hormone). When the subjects thought they were drinking a low-fat milkshake, ghrelin increased; when they thought it was high-fat, ghrelin decreased. This shows that one’s perspective on what they’re eating causes a direct physiological response. When a person is eating healthy food it’s good to have the correct mindset. If they think it’s delicious, nutritious, and decadent, the food has a higher nutritional value. If they think healthy food is disgusting, distasteful, and unfulfilling, the person gains less benefits. The nocebos that state healthy food is undesirable, which has permeated throughout cultures around the world, continue to cause long-term issues.

A nocebo effect occurs when an individual only learns about the negative aspects of whatever they are encountering. These notions can cause a plethora of symptoms in any psychosociological event. In a study (Implicit Theories of Intelligence Predict Achievement across an Adolescent Transition: A Longitudinal Study and an Intervention, 2007) done by Lisa S Blackwell and her colleagues, they tried to evaluate how a student’s theories about intelligence influenced their outcomes. The test focused on adolescents transitioning from the 7th grade to the 8th grade because of the high stress environment. One group of students were taught that intelligence is a long-term effort-based pursuit. The other students received a standard education with no additional guidance. The students that weren’t given any insights about intelligence mindsets proceeded to struggle in their courses while the others started to excel. This indicates the importance of having an effort-based positive mindset, instead of an end-based negative mindset, when pursuing all forms of intelligence. Negative mindsets usually come from one’s social engagements which makes them very hard to avoid. In medicine, doctors have to be extremely careful with their words, body language, and competency. If they emphasize the adverse effects of a medication, it can increase the chance of a patient having those symptoms. Also, if a health care professional mentions other patients not feeling any effects from a drug the recipient may see little to no benefits from their treatment. The nocebo effect can induce a variety of symptoms over one’s life; most of the time the person doesn’t even know a nocebo is contributing to their issues. This is a major reason people need to learn the power of perceptual persuasions.

When one learns to harness perceptual persuasions, they can manipulate their psychophysiology very reliably. This can increase a person’s ability to leverage anxiety and other forms of stress to achieve their goals. It all starts with the individual’s beliefs that have been instilled over their lifetime. To persuade one’s perceptions, it helps to think of the brain as a computer. The old beliefs are out-of-date software, and it’s going to take a little effort to reformat them to an up-to-date version. For example, most people consider stress to be a bad thing. This is because a lot of cultures constantly promote how awful stress is for an individual’s health. The truth is those statistics only represent one half of the equation. Stress also improves focus, hormone production, and can cause positive adaptations over time. When a person swaps the old belief with a mindset which amplifies the positive aspects of stress, it can have profound effects on their short and long-term health (Crum, Alia J., and Damon J. Phillips. Self-Fulfilling Prophesies, Placebo Effects, and the Social–Psychological Creation of Reality, 2015). As a culture, it would be good to promote the positive aspects of stress opposed to only the negatives. Yes, stress is not ideal, but everyone will encounter it in their life; having the correct mindset can have a massive impact on one’s psychophysiological responses.

Individuals can change their objective reality simply by changing their beliefs. These persuasions become particularly potent when paired with positive inputs, such as pursuing goals, exercising, and eating healthy. Not only does the individual receive the benefits from the objectively positive input, but they can gain increased benefits from their expectations. In some cases, the placebo effect accounts for over 80% of a drug’s effectiveness (Robson, David. The Expectation Effect. Canongate, 2022.), and in other cases, nocebos cause patients to incur negative symptoms. This is enough of a reason to seriously consider the power of one’s beliefs. Placebo effects, nocebo effects, and perceptual persuasions are a core component of a person’s outcomes in all avenues. Thus, when one thinks of all the nonsense they encounter throughout the day trying to tilt them towards a negative mindset, they realize there is a lot of mental reprogramming to be done. Thankfully these mindsets can be changed and have an immediate impact on one’s psychophysiology.

Overcoming Fears of The Known & Unknown: Through Blind Eyes (Non-Fiction),"Hi, I’m a legally blind indie author and recently self-published my first book on Amazon/Kindle.

Sample from Chapter 2: Meaning Means More Than I Thought It Meant  
  
What is your meaning?   
  
This was a very useful question for me. Honestly before I answered it, I was aimless and almost never happy. I got my joy from external sources like comedies, games, and great people. Don't get me wrong all of these things are amazing. But once I found my meaning, the thing I truly wanted out of life, I was able to find joy chasing goals that move me towards it.  
  
What is meaning?   
  
Meaning for most people is your purpose. The driving force that gets you out of bed in the morning and the thing that keeps you up at night working to reach it. Some people find their meaning in money and objects, some find it in competition, some find it in love, or some find their meaning in a combination of these things.   
  
When I learned this, I was at a low point in my life. My body had become a frail weak shell from a series of perpetual injuries. I just delt with my third kidney stone, which was not a great experience. On top of that awesome physical bullshit, I was shrouded in self-pity and an I'm worthless mentality from years of letting my mind beat me down.

Titles and blurbs will also be covered here. Then part 4 will be the publishing process & how to decide between indie and traditional, the pros & cons of each, and how to go about it. I'll also be covering marketing and advertising here.

Anyone else self-publish with the intention to go trad. later on?,"Just the title, really. 
I've self-published 2 books so far, and I've got a second version of one of them coming out within the next 10 days. I intend on self-publishing the next two or three books.
But after that I want to go traditional. I want to go through an agent, through a publishing house, through an editorial team. 
I don't want to be doing it alone the entire time.
I self-publish because I'm a control freak when it comes to my covers, and because of circumstances outside of my control which make me feel trapped, and this is my one thing that I can do to stay in control of what I *can* control.
But once these circumstances change? Once I'm not trying to micromanage every possible thing I can? I want to go traditional. I want to republish my self-published books through an actual publishing house. I want to be in bookstores, and be recognised as a legitimate professional author, rather than just... a DIY writer.

Does anyone else feel like this? Is anyone else intending to approach a publishing house in the future, after being self-published for a while?",4,9,2023-07-22,deleted,N/A,0.84

New Book Release,"Hello everyone!!!!

So I’m a new (indie) author and I’ve struggling with promoting my book and so I came here to do so. I’d been working on it for 2years and I am so excited to finally have had been able to push the publish button. This book holds all the passion I’ve ever had and is a dream I’ve had since third grade. 

This is a fantasy book with supernatural magical vibes. It may give you deja vu about other books or even movies that you’ve seen or read. The idea with this book is to show how woman are strong and can find a way to survive through even the worst experiences. However it’s not only women, buts it’s also how men who have been wronged in so many ways also manage to survive in a harsh environment when put in a difficult and painful decision. 

The main character is a 19 year old female who is trying to survive on her own after her family and home had been burned down and killed for a reason she doesn’t know about. While planning a revenge for the people after her, she discovers truths as well as who she is as a person and knows that she will not give up until she reaches her revenge. There are going to be many plot twists throughout the book as well as new characters and a mystery romance that could be enemies to lovers or fated mates. 

If this sounds like anything you or someone you know might be interested in and you are willing to give me and my book a chance I would be incredibly thankful.

"New Author Frozen in the Editing process, please help","Hello, I'm a new author, not yet published. I received my novella( length? ) back from my editor and a lot of the suggestions sound like those for a non-romance book. Currently my wip is about 18-19k words long.

I'm **writing SciFi Romance** and the editor has said that I need more world building and more I detail, but the details she is asking for or questions she says need to be addressed seem like technical details to me. But I'm not sure. I feel like by the time I add a lot of the things she asks for it will turn into a full novel.

**A short synopsis of the first chapter:** It is vague because it is a dream, the reader might be able to figure out it's a dream while reading, but it is confirmed to be a dream at the end of the short chapter when the FMC wakes up and dashes down the hall of the ship to the misters ( showers ). In the dream the FMC is excited because this will be her first time on the asteroid where her crew will be working and this will be only the 3rd space place she has been. She was born on Earth and lived there till she was 25 when she went to another planet to look for work, was there for maybe a week before getting a job on an explorer ship and now they are in space and about to land on the asteroid.The FMC is in the antechamber with crew members as the transport ship touches down. She is excited and talking to her friend, the bay door opens and the crew start filing out but the FMC starts floating up. She is pulled down by the the being who will be the MMC. The MMC tells her she forgot to turn her gravity on. He activates the bay door closure and reaches into the FMC's suite and turns the switch situated at her waist to the proper setting. Dreamed romance ensues from there with his glove grazing her skin at the gap of her under tunic and pants. He pulls his glove off, unzips her suit a little more to expose her waist more and caressed her waist over her tunic, there is prolonged eye contact before she nods and his hand moves under her tunic.  She closes her eyes enjoying the sensations. He speaks to her. "" Their helmets had disappeared."" Exact line from the story. He wants her to look at him, he caresses her face and she speaks to him. They begin kissing, and a little make out session happens. And the FMC wakes up hot and bothered and goes off to the misters ( like a shower ).

***A few examples:***

**What I wrote:**  The transport ship they were now on enroute to the worksite had already delivered the largest equipment to the asteroid. Now, after weeks of training onboard the expedition freighter, this would be her first time out on the surface of Vestra.\[IP2\]

**Editor's comment:** \[IP2\]Can we learn a little bit about what her job will entail? You don't have to go super into detail, but you want to give readers a sense of where Kim has been, where she's at now, and where she's headed.

\-This seems , to me, like detail that is very much not needed in the 1st paragraph of the story.

&#x200B;

**What I wrote:**  He bent down, and their face shields bumped lightly. \[IP1\]

**Editor's comment:** \[IP1\]Knowing that she's wearing a space suit (I assume) earlier would have been cool! I've got no idea what the atmosphere is like on this ship or the asteroid.

\-I really don't get this, it is a Science Fiction Romance. The previous chapter was all about the FMC standing in the antechamber as the ship lands on the asteroid and they are about to exit to their worksite on the asteroid surface. Is it not obvious that they would be wearing suits of some type?

&#x200B;

**What I wrote:**   “What?” was all she could stupidly say. She was face to face with a handsome alien. \[IP1\]

**Editor's comment:** \[IP1\]What does he look like? This would be a great opportunity for some worldbuilding and character building. You can't just say he's sexy or handsome, you've got to convince me.

\-Ok I can maybe add a little description of the MMC here I agree, but this is 684 words into the story, and this is a dream sequence. I think the editor hasn't figured it out that it is a dream yet, but even at the end there are no comments that things make more sense to her once she realizes it is vague because it is a dream. But also, world building and character building needs to be increased in the 1st 684 words? I do go into more details in the next chapters.

&#x200B;

**What I wrote:**   He gave another chuckle. “Your inter-suit gravity must activate before you go out into the atmosphere.” \[IP1\] He reached into her suit \[IP2\] and switched the gravity control situated at the inside waist band to the correct setting. \[IP3\]

**Editor's comments:** \[IP1\]How come hers was switched off but the other peoples' suits weren't? What happened to \[ FMC's friend\]? Did \[FMC's friend\] leave her behind? I don't think we know \[FMC's friend's\] gender, either.\[IP2\]How can he reach into her suit? Isn't the point of them that they're meant to be airtight, to prevent asphyxiation? Or did he open it somehow?\[IP3\]How is she supposed to switch it on and off at will if it's in a place she can't reach?

\-In the first 2-3 paragraphs I talk about the FMC being newly off Earth where she lived a life sheltered from most alien contact. I write about how the FMC is very excited, even gripping her friends hand squeezing it as the ship lands. In my mind it is logical that the FMC could have forgotten to activate her suit's gravity. And then have the MMC explain and help her. And the questions about the FMC's friend here are just odd, but 1 more clue that this could be a dream. Like when your with a group of people in a dream then the scene suddenly changes or you find the group gone and you only with 1 other person. There are multiple clues that this is a dream all through this chapter.

\-I do see that I can add a line or two about him opening the access panel hiding the zipper of her suit down the front of the suit.The 3rd comment I don't understand at all. I write that the switch is situated at her waist. Maybe with the added access panel and zipper description it will be clear that the access is at the front of her suit and once zipped down the ""inside waist band"" area will be clearer.? IDK, And maybe with that additional description it should be more obvious that the switch is in a reachable place. It was just a rookie mistake that she forgot to turn it on when she put her suit on.

\-I guess I need to get a sense of is the editor on track even for a romance book that I need to add a lot more details? And this is just a small sample of the comments and suggestions the editor made of the 1st 790 words of my story.

&#x200B;

I'm concerned that all the additional details, and world building will turn off romance readers, but maybe my novella really is full of holes and this will just turn into a full length novel once I edit it to the editor's satisfaction.

And I'm new to this remember, so this is my 1st completed? work and my first time working with an editor. I chose this editor because they were recommended by a respected author in an indie marketing group I'm in and the names of other authors the editor has worked with are names I recognized as being published indie authors, including a romance author. Also I liked that she was so detailed in the sample edit.

Help me please, I know this is long, but I really am stuck. I don't know which way to go as far as editing to the editor's satisfaction or believing I understand the SciFi Romance genre more ( the editor writes fantasy books besides editing and is a published author) and being more selective when take the editor's advice when it comes to adding more description and world building.

Chapter 2  
“Hazardous? I’ll show that manipulative, misanthropic, anti-establishment cretin just what hazardous means if he thinks I’m going to fold on this!”  
The sound of vigorous guitar riffs made a fitting accompaniment to the angry tirade despite originating on opposite sides of the communal area. Ama was glaring at a laptop that sat on a stained oak desk shoved against the large table near the kitchen. She tapped a fingernail on the wood as she read through the alert.  
“And what violation of basic human dignity has her royal prudishness’s undies in a bunch?” Em demanded with an affected sneer without looking up from his guitar scales.  
“Oh you’ll agree with this one tree-hugger,” Drake muttered from where he sat oiling his work boots.  
“Yeah,” Donny piped up, “Finney is trying to kill a perfectly healthy fir.”  
“What!” Em demanded, carefully placing his battered old acoustic guitar down in its case and darting over to look at the computer screen. “You mean apark tree?”  
Despite her simmering frustration Ama allowed a small smile to flicker across her face as she continued to type.  
“Get out of your pajamas and I’ll tell you,” Drake ordered pointing towards the bathroom door with a stained rag. “School starts in forty-five minutes and you still have breakfast and chores. That goes for you too Pip-squirt.”  
“I hope you washed your hands before you touched our food,” Em said with a frown.  
“Boot grease makes a great source of fatty acids.” Drake retorted. “Now go!”  
The two smaller boys muttered in annoyance but stumbled off to follow orders.  
“So what is up?” the youth asked as he bent his head back over the smooth leather of his boots.  
“Mrs. Finney wants that tree down that’s blocking her perfect view of Crescent Lake.” Ama replied in a dry tone.  
“One that’s clearly on park property?” Drake asked.  
“Indeedy-do.” Ama replied giving the paper in front of her a glare.  
“So how’s she justifying it?” Drake asked.  
“As a safety hazard to her house.” Ama replied.  
“And?”  
The biologist groaned and rubbed her face.  
“As far as I can tell the trunk is perfectly healthy. There is an old trash can lid grown into the trunk and a little discolored sap is leaking out there.”  
“Frass?”  
“Watch your language!” Donny interjected as he darted up to the table.  
“Frass is not a bad word,” Drake stated.  “Have you let the chickens out?”  
“Yes, what does frass mean?” Donny asked as he started piling stir-fry onto his plate.  
“Look it up.” Drake ordered him.  “Emerald! Breakfast ends in ten minutes! Get your tukus down here!”  
“It’s bad health to rush meals,” Em snapped out as he came down a narrow stairway with deliberate slowness.  
“It’s even worse for your health to skip meals altogether,” Drake growled threateningly.  
“Shut it and give me some eggs.” Em snapped back.  
“Emerald Waters Undersun,” Drake hissed out through gritted teeth. “You are going to get your own eggs.”  
The boy threw himself into a chair and glared at Drake with challenge in every line of his body.  
“Emerald,” Ama said in a calm tone. “I think you should apologize to your cousin now.”  
“Sorry I disturbed you Ama,” he offered without breaking eye contact with Drake.  
“Not me, him,” Ama said.  
“Sorry you had to hear that Donny.” Em said.  
Ama heaved a sigh and closed her computer.  
“Emerald,” Ama said.  
“Do you want to eat or go hungry?” Drake demanded.  
Ama glanced at him with a familiar uneasy look in her eyes and Drake fought down a wince.  
“Now, Em.” she said in a patient tone.  
“I’ll go hungry,” Em snapped, jumping up and stalking over to the couch.  
Donny kept his eyes fixed on his plate. Ama heaved a sigh before turning back to her computer. Em wriggled on the couch for several minutes before skulking back to the table. Drake moved to intercept him but Ama stopped him with a look and he let Em serve himself. Drake cast irritated glances at the wall clock as the time crept more and more into school time.  
Ama closed her computer and stood, then sighed, sat and opened it again.  
“I need to pick out their report topics,” Ama muttered.  
“I could do it,” Drake offered.  
“You do quite enough,” Ama replied briskly, as she scanned the news. “Here you go. For Donny, malfunctions at the Lewis- McChord Air Force Base air show.” A frown creased her face. “Wow, this is pretty serious. It looks like the F-16 demonstration team nearly got killed.”  
Drake whistled and leaned over her shoulder.  
“Multiple system failures,” he read out loud. “I am pretty sure that isn’t supposed to happen.”  
“Nope,” Ama agreed. “Here is a topic on big game management for Em.”  
“Reports due by next week?” Drake asked as the old printer on the desk began to squeal and grumble as it powered up.  
“Same as usual,” Ama confirmed.  
Drake put the printouts on top of the homework pile and moved to wash up the breakfast dishes.  
“I need to get to work early today so you two be good for Drake,” she called out placing a quick kiss on top of the smaller boys’ heads and giving Drake’s shoulder a friendly squeeze.  
“Good luck with Mrs. Finney, and stay safe.” Drake called out as she went into her room.  
The table was cleaned off and wiped down and the clink of forks gave way to the steady scratch of pencils on paper. They broke for a recess after religion and then lunch after history and math, and by the time the Grandfather clock in the corner struck two the younger boys twitching with energy. Drake made certain the internet was disconnected at the router, and chased Donny and Em out into the garden.  
“And don’t come in until dark,” he ordered tossing two snack bags out after them.  
Donny as usual snatched his food and disappeared into the small orachard. Low grumbles about troglodytes and the Amish wandered out into the high corn following Em and Drake shook his head in exasperation wondering, not for the first time how the dark haired princeling came from the same gene pool as his little brother. The kitchen being mostly ordered Drake was turning to put the last random dirty sock in the hamper when a gnarled hand clutching a cane head appeared in the corner of his eye, causing his heart to make a valiant attempt to bolt out of his throat.  
“Abuelita!” he gasped forcing his hands down from the guard position. “Where did you come from?”  
Smoldering black eyes ran searchingly over the tall youth. An impossibly long mane of streaked silver and black hair was barely contained in a thick braid. A sharply pointed nose perched over a small wrinkled mouth. A vibrant red horse-hair serape hung over her shoulders concealing everything except her brown and gnarled hands which currently clutched the old tree branch she used as a cane. Drake had been more than a little comforted by the fact that both Em and Donny had admitted to having the  thought ‘witch’ every time time they saw her as well.  
“From the hand of God by the bodies of my sainted mother and father,” she replied after a long, uncomfortable silence.  
She always spoke in a low husky voice that suggested years of smoking, though Drake had never smelled even stale smoke on her.  
“Right,” Drake blinked and grinned at the response; the one she always gave. “So you are here for their Spanish lesson? I have their grammar books ready and-”  
The narrow end of the tree branch rapped against the concrete of the floor causing Drake to jump. Abuelita glared at him, locking his gaze and holding him in place with it for a moment.  
“I am here for their lessons,” she finally stated, “and you are there for my payment.”  
Drake thought longingly of the repair and maintenance manuals in the cab of the truck and the new tool he was itching to try, but he forced a grin on his face.  
“Yes ma’am,” he said. “What can I get you today?”  
Abuelita pulled out a bag of woven grass from under her serape causing the indistinct patterns on the cloth to shift and change.  
“Take this,” she ordered him, “and collect me the cobalt blue berries that grow on a single stalk close to the ground. They must come from the mountain to the south east of here by the crystal brook.”  
Drake nodded, and took the little bag, he didn’t quite manage to infused his gestures with enthusiasm he supposed.  The old woman, probably wouldn’t have noted it anyway. She turned and moved towards the garden door without waiting for any other reply. However she called out over her shoulder as he turned to find his own way out of the rambling structure.  
“Don’t dawdle little one. A storm brews in the distance.”  
He tried not to roll his eyes at that, the weather forecast was clear and eighties for the next week according to the morning fire report Ama had printed. The youth only nodded and slipped around the corner. He circled the barn and pulled a set of loose tan pants and tunic out of the cubby. The soft worn leather almost perfectly matched the forest floor for color as did the moccasins he pulled on after them. His morning running clothes were modern stuff that wicked the sweat away from him and let him speed through the forest. These were his free day clothes. The ones that let him disappear into the forest and wander. Abuelita, for all of her demands, would tend Em and Donny until he returned no matter how late that was, and with the Park’s yearly budget talks still under way it was highly unlikely Ama would be home until long after the sun had set. Despite still hearing the call of the half restored truck he felt something lossening in him already. The soft cotton and smooth leather rested easily against his skin and Drake slipped into the forest.  
Freedom; for the moment at least, blissful freedom. Pushing aside the guilt that accompanied the thought as well as any lingering worries about his charges the youth let his legs carry him through the trees.  He shunned the man made paths, following the faint animal trails. This close to the barn they were as clear to him as if they were named city streets. Being animal trails, they invariably led him to water. Today he stopped at a trickling stream, took off his moccasins, and rolled up his pants legs. The youth turned and followed the thin flow of icy water upstream, letting it steal the heat from his body through his feet.  
Some  distance upstream, the stream widened and pooled under a boulder. There Drake paused and pulled an old black compass out of his pocket. Behind him he knew every trail and tree. Ahead was a broad swath of National Wilderness he would have to cross, or possibly Bureau of Land Management or even state managed forests where he more rarely wandered. It was hard to tell where the boundaries were from the ground. The clearing he wanted for the berries was solidly in BLM land and he still had quite a ways to go to get there. The stand of timber that stood between him and his goal was dense with young tree and branches that frequently formed impenetrable hedges he had to track around and he checked his compass regularly as he climbed in elevation. Even so the youth found he had wandered too far off his route and had to correct when he spotted the boundary fence. However he was in no hurry and he reached the clearing long before the sun told him it was time to turn around.  
Sometime in the past some unknown force had carved a shallow trench across the side of one of the small mountains that that dotted the wilderness. It had puzzled Drake at first. The scour was at the wrong angle to be an old rock slide, and terminated in a near perfectly circular clearing at the lower end. Centuries old Douglas Firs abruptly gave way to a second ring only a few decades old. Those were in turn beginning to produce cones and a smattering of knee high saplings. The rest of the space was completely given over to wildflowers. No matter what season Drake visited it he found a riot of life.  
There had been an early spring and many herbs that normally would have waited a month or more were already in full bloom in the mountain meadow. A white wave of foamflower washed in from the deep forest surrounding the clearing, sending up knee high stalks covered in the delicate white blooms. Late trillium hid close to the roots of the great firs, many having shed their white corollas and begun to put forth their bulbous seed heads. Fuzzy white baneberry blossoms nodded gently in the breeze. A riot of yellow and purple spread across the ground as vetch and buttercups and a host of clovers competed for space in the open sun. Great stalks of lupine as high as his head thrust up their purple and blue proudly from thick clusters of palm shaped leaves. Pink shooting stars and violet harebells crouched under the protection of the larger plants. Indian paintbrush lit the scene with flames of red and orange. Where a spring seeped into the meadow elephant’s head flared neon pink and corydalis bushes put forth blushing blooms. Pale green wild orchids stood along the wet spot and the swarms of bees danced from them to the glacier lilies.  
Sometimes, as he bent over a tiny blossom and traced the intricate network of veins in the petals, drank in the scent, and felt the smooth surface of the leaves an otherworldly feeling would come over him. It was as if there was another world just out of range of his senses. If he could only really look, the thin illusion that was blocking him would slip away and reveal the real world underneath it.  
“Look Awiegwa,” his father would whisper, pointing at a deer mouse perched on a fallen log. “What does it see?”  
Awiegwa would screw up his face and squint. Trying to find the answer to the question.  
Awiegwa had often wondered how so many flowers had come to be in the relatively small area. He had identified dozens of species and there were more he had yet to determine. The clearing was always the first place to bloom and the last to go dormant. Many of the flowers seemed to utterly defy their usual blooming patterns. However, as time passed he had simply come to accept it. It was one of the small good things that brought back the memories of his father. If it didn’t quite follow the rules Ama had taught him, well an impossible clearing in the mountains wasn’t a place for rules.  
The particular bloom that Abuelita had requested had taken full advantage of the early sun and had already put forth a few cobalt blue berries; easily spotted at the edge of the clearing in the delicate sea of white flowers.  
However before he left the shade of the forest for the meadow the youth paused and closed his eyes. Bole wasn’t always here, but he was often enough that Awiegwa always checked for him. Carefully he reconstructed the clearing in his mind; marking every tree and boulder on the edge. Three years he had been coming here and each time it was easier to recreate the clearing. Breathing evenly he opened his eyes, letting the mental image merge with the actual. There was a brief moment of confusion as details like the play of light through branches and the trembling of small clusters of flowers fixed themselves but there was only one truly jarring note. Awiegwa didn’t let his eyes focus on the disparity; he never did anymore, but a warm smile spread across his features as he slipped silently into the meadow.  
He was here. As the youth moved in a low crouch, gathering the first fruits of the Queen’s Cup, he let his peripheral vision linger on a particular snag. There was nothing obviously interesting about it, other than the fact that it had not been there the last time Awiegwa was here. He had named the wanderer Bole, because it most often appeared as a thick tree trunk; sometimes living, sometimes dead. Occasionally it would be a boulder or simply a mound in the dirt. Often it wasn’t in the clearing at all. If the youth moved forward and tried to closely examine it he could never find anything to suggest it was something other than a tree or rock.  
He had thought about taking a sample occasionally, had taken his knife out to do just that more than once, but something always held him back. Bole was a part of this place. Dissecting him would be too much like attempting to dissect his sense of his father’s presence here. The youth had never told anyone about this place, not even Ama with who could get most things out of him easily enough. Down at the house, in town, when he was Drake; solid, reliable, first up in the morning, two grades ahead in school with a penchant for science Drake, a productive member of modern society with a promising future and his mother smiling at him. Here he could be Awiegwa. Here he could believe in the ancient medicines his father had dug out of dusty old tomes and brought to life from the forest litter. Every time Awiegwa left the clearing and headed back towards home reality would reassert itself. Bole would resolve back into a figment of his imagination, created from pride in a somewhat better than average memory and what the social workers had called an “intriguing imagination”. When he reached the house and become solidly Drake again flickers of embarrassment would begin eating at him for letting his senses trick him like that, but as long as the blooms nodded around him in this garden Bole could exist even on a Thursday.  
The little woven grass bag filled up with the berries fairly quickly and Awiegwa soon stretched out of his crouch and let his gaze wander contentedly over the clearing. As it always did, the warm space was working its special magic. Worries about Em getting out of his schoolwork, of not paying enough attention to the quiet Donny, of letting Ama see his petty resentments: it had all melted away from his muscles, thoughts of college costs and abandoning his duties dissolved into an acute sense of the now. The leaves rustled softly in a barely-there breeze, the heavy scent of some unidentified blossom filled his lungs, a dozen shades of green framed the rainbow of flowers, and over and above it all the creaking of the firs as the wind played over them. It was at times like these that he felth he could almost see into heaven; that something wonderful that existed just beyond his senses, and all he had to do was reach out and claim it.  
The youth took a deep breath and let himself fall backwards onto a handy rise in the forest floor. His path had taken him to the foot of the snag and he shifted slightly to align himself with the gnarled roots. One hand gripped a time smoothed root.  
“Ama trusted me enough to go out of state,” he murmured. “That’s the first time she’s done that. Usually she has Abulita stay with us to fend off the Harsh, but she said it’s  long past legal now.”  
It was his imagination of course that made him think the root vibrated in his hand in response. Many a long hour he had spent in this clearing with the wanderer. He had poured out his frustrations and anguishes over life’s injustices, had shared his secrets as he grew, and had shouted his triumphs. Sometimes he felt closer to Bole than to any of his human friends. However, something that sounded like his mother’s voice warned him that there was something odd about this and that awareness was the main reason he had kept this place secret from Ama. Their mother hadn’t exactly liked stuff like that. She had never objected to his father’s digging up the old stories of her people. Making cross generational connections between elders, who more often than not lived isolated lives, and the next generation, was an admirable goal in of itself in her eyes; objectively a social good. Storytelling was only the natural course for these relationships to take,  but subtle looks had warned even a very young Drake that it was best to cautious what he shared with his mother. At least of those things that couldn’t be placed on a microscope slide. So this was Awigewa’s place, and while  his father’s spirit wanders the flowers with he had never felt his mother here.  
He let his focus drift up, and up. Dark blue Lupine nodded over his head framing the faint crisscross of jet contrails that threw a light haze over an otherwise cloudless sky. His clothed grew deliciously hot from the spring sun. The ground too had eagerly accepted the energy and now it conducted the heat into the muscles of his back. Bole’s wood beneath him was warmer even than the surrounding ground and an idle thought traced across Awiegwa’s awareness; something about it being odd for the light colored wood and relatively dry wood to retain more heat than the darker soil surrounding it. His mind was filled with the impression of a goal. He had been meaning to do, something. Something fun, yes, exploring, he’d meant to see if whatever had dug that den by the second boulder was cubing this year. He would just get  up and do that in a minute. His back was so warm and comfortable.

Gehenna: A Novella Inspired by the Manson Murders,"Available [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Three-Stories-Sunbather-Kitsune-Gehenna/dp/B0BXNCQGZ8/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1683203637&sr=8-2) (as part of a three novella collection):

Deep in the desert there is a fire that never goes out. There lives a small family of outcasted people. These people have dedicated their lives to keeping the pyre ever burning. The reason for this, before I arrived, I didn’t know. But there was something alluring about it. I connected to this notion of alienation from the pains of the modern day, of finding peace in simple living. Far away from cars, pollution, and noise. Far away from nine to fives and microwave meals. Far from all the struggles of existence, there was potential peace. A life free of debt, free of worry and sadness. Free of faked orgasms and relationships that exist only so there’s another unfulfilled carcass to hold close when the end is drawing near. When the fear of death begins to swallow you whole.

Gehenna follows the story of an orphan looking for a place to belong. Inspired by the Manson murders, the story takes the reader through themes of societal rejection and the meaning of morality.

""What a book! The protagonist is enviably strong, yet believably fragile; the antagonist is disgustingly vile yet attractively charismatic; and the story is grounded yet etherially occult.

20-Year Indie Author,"**Hey Folks--**

Thought I'd join this sub.

I've been an indie author going on two decades. I've got 25 books formally published, a bunch of works-in-progress, and a bunch of fan fiction as well. [My website is here](https://thepiertoforever.com/).

I don't do business with Amazon, because I want full control of every aspect of my work, including pricing, at any and all times. Moreover, I have serious issues with Amazon's Wild, Wild West approach to indie authors. I publish through Draft2Digital, and am on most every other channel.

Allow me to give a big shout-out to Payhip, who hosts my site. I have never met a friendlier, more dedicated, more professional group than those folks. Their platform is versatile, easy to set up, easy to maintain, and very professional-looking. Give them a serious look-see. You'll be happy you did.

I'm not an expert on marketing, and frankly, I spend very little time doing so. I post links to my works on [my own subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TLCAC/new/) every day, but that's pretty much it. I am very much in [Seth Godin](https://www.sethgodin.com/)'s camp about finding your smallest viable audience and delighting them, not in getting on some bestseller list. If you're a fiction writer like me, you may know that fewer than a thousand individuals *worldwide* make a living from their creative efforts. The game is totally rigged, and you're on the losing side. So focus on those few who really care, and forget the rest. I've done that, and it has brought me nothing but joy, especially compared to every other approach, which, I can assure you, I've tried.

At one time I thought about setting up one of those old-fashioned webrings (does anybody else miss the ""old"" internet?) with other interested authors, but that idea has always met with a giant gray wall of indifference and apathy. I'm still interested in doing it, though. If you are as well, let me know.

Found another Indie author with a similar book title as my book,"To give some needed background information without disclosing too much, I published a book (with the proper noun censored) on April 9th, 2021 with the title ""The {x} Chronicles Book One: {y}"". The book was part of a passion project I've been working on for years. I am really passionate about this series. It means a lot to me, even as I draft the sequel. As an indie author, it's hard to get the word out.  


Moreover about an hour ago, I found another indie author who had published a book in 2022 with a similar series name as mine. Instead of ""The {x} Chronicles"" his series was called ""The Chronicles of {x}"". I had never heard of this author before. I simply stumbled upon it by looking up my own book series on Amazon for the link of my book! Also to note, they are of similar genres. I won't specify what genre, just that they are of the same classification.

I looked and looked over the web as much as I could and could only find a couple social media profiles for him, but he doesn't seem very active. Is it reasonable to ask him to change the name of his series? I completely respect that he's publishing his work, but since he published his work \*after\* mine, and I'm seeking to get the word out about mine as much as possible.   


I don't want to be a pushover and just ""let it slide"". I'm sure that he never knew about my series just like I hadn't known about his. But shouldn't I be concerned since I'm seeking more attention on my book? I'd hate to have my series get mixed up with his. I just think that he should be the one to change his series name since my series came first. Am I wrong for this?",1,5,2023-03-19,CopperPenguin96,N/A,1.0
Debut Novel - Kolahni: Secrets Within,"Hi everyone!

I wanted to announce my debut novel *Kolahni: Secrets Within*. It's a YA sci fi, cross genre novel. 

Blurb:   

Elayne is a college student trying to fill a void inside her she can't seem to fill with her extracurricular activities. It's not until powers are activated inside her that the emptiness begins to fill. Elayne's mind is thrust into accepting a new reality where elements can be manipulated by emotions. She will need to figure out how to control her feelings and allow her emotions to control her newfound power. 

As she learns about these powers, she is confronted by an entity of unknown origin, and learns his plans to take over the world. With the help of her roommates and Golden - will Elayne find peace, love, and be able to stop this entity before it's too late?

**Tropes, Kinks, Trigger and Content Warnings:** *Kolahni: Secrets Within* is a cross genre of fictional books. It starts as Urban Fiction, crosses into Science Fiction and Space Opera, with a little romance. There is a brief possession of a body - but it's brief. There is a mention of a car accident death - but no gore. There is also a kiss mentioned - but no details other than that. There is also a death scene where a head hangs limping at the side.

It's currently on Amazon and Kindle Unlimited. I would appreciate it if anyone would read it and leave a review. Thanks!

My debut book has been just been released!,"It's not much compared to many of the posts here. But I have been writing poems and scrapping them for years. Finally I have worked up the courage to publish a simple but hopefully enjoyable nursery rhyme picture book.

Amazon Purchases Not Listed on Authors KDP Order Report,"I had a friend in India purchase an eBook on January 5th. According to when orders post the orders page this purchase should have reflected by January 8th. The same friend left a verified purchase review on January 12.

However, the purchase never reflected on my KDP orders or my estimated royalties reports. I had my friend send me a screenshot of their order so I could forward to Amazon support. To this day Amazon support cannot locate the order and I have been passed through 3 personnel responding to the missing order.

I researched other reddit posts and social media sites. Some users state Amazon theft, others state purchaser theft, and others state sometimes technical difficulties happen.

Does anyone have suggestions or solutions that may assist in what happened and if the order still isn't found that I am just sol? Thank you!",3,4,2023-02-01,acw819,N/A,0.81

Questions:

3-      Do you prefer romantic stories with a happy or sad ending, and why?

Introducing myself and my books,"Hey guys, I'm an indie author that works full time (not sure I know any that don't lol). I'm new to Reddit, but I hear a lot of authors indie and non are here, so I figured I'd jump in. I'm a fantasy, sci-fi, and horror writer, and I have a trilogy out called ""The Salom'Sileyu Trilogy"" ([Click here to check it all out](https://www.lulu.com/search?contributor=Zachael+T.J.+Presgrove&page=1&pageSize=10&adult_audience_rating=00)). I have a website/blog [here](https://www.zachaeltjp.com) that shares a little bit more personal information about me that you can take a look at.

I'm from Jersey (go ahead and get your tomatoes ready), and am pretty passionate about writing and story-telling. I used to be religious, but have since walked a different path. I'm also a gamer, pretty big into DnD, MtG, and find my inspiration from a lot of different fantasy and sci-fi worlds/universes. I'm sarcastic, and am far better at conveying my thoughts through writing than talking.

My books are mainly centered around a science-fantasy universe I've titled ""The Divine Logician Universe,"" and once I have more titles and have built a big enough base, I want to expand it. The Trilogy is loosely presented as an elf punk, but mostly because that's the closest thing I could find to put it in. 

Anyways, introduce yourselves and your own titles if you have any published, and ask me any questions you have! I'm excited to get to know everyone.",4,2,2022-12-15,FetusYeetus91,N/A,0.84

Published my first book on Amazon Kindle,"Recently, I published my first book, the Sanguine Elf, on Amazon kindle.  It is a wonderful feeling to finally get this book out especially give the circumstances around the book.

A while back, a friend of mine and I had his discussion about what they’d like to see in a book.  They talked about an elf being captured by a vampire and having all sorts of spicy elements to it.  I took that concept and made it into the book.  Although I changed quite a few things namely the capture part.

The only sad thing is what happened to my friend.  Two months before the book was released, they passed away. 

In the weeks and months after that, I resolved that the book needed to be published for them.  To fulfill at least one final wish.",6,4,2022-11-12,GeorgeBarretWriter,N/A,0.88
Kickstarter for pre-orders?,"Does anyone have experience doing a Kickstarter to fund the production of their indie book through preorders?

I've ran four successful campaigns before but they were for comics and I feel like I'm building up an audience from scratch again.

TODAY I LEARNED...,"THAT if you have a small network like I do, it is very difficult to sell your book...

THAT even by constantly working on social media and different outlets, it is very difficult to sell your book...

THAT if you're shy and don't like being imposing, it is very difficult to sell your book...

THAT your book being popular is for only a moment when you're unknown...

BUT I feel proud for the book I put out into this world, a legacy I hope my daughter will be proud of...

FOR my hard work and effortless attempts to getting it discovered (though not successfully in these early stages)...

FOR understanding that not everyone wants to read a book about cancer, even though the book is inspiring and brings hope to patients and families...

FOR realizing that it's not that I have failed as a writer because my book is not famous...

FOR always hoping something great will happen with my message in the book I poured my heart into...

FOR appreciating those that supported my journey, my book, and trying to help in spreading the word.

FOR learning the ropes of writing and publishing.

FOR doing so much research and seeing that I need to put out more books to get better recognized. 

AND FOR THE WONDERFUL GIFT that has been given to me to be able to share stories with the world.

Tremendous Book Reviews," (If this isnt ok to post, please remove)

Hello, Self-Published Authors!!!

I have restarted my Book Review YT channel. I had been doing book review for a short while prior to COVID, but after the pandemic hit, I had to stop in order to ensure I could pay my bills. That's all situated now, so I can get back to reading and reviewing. Wanted to take the time to share my channel with everyone here and invite you to check it out. I have an intro video that gives a full breakdown of what I do, how it's useful to you, and how to go about submitting your book for a Tremendous Book Review!

(There's an e-Sticker!!)

BLUF: I read your book, and then give a full, in-depth review of your story going over what I liked and disliked. You can use that video to hone your craft, promotional/advertising purposes, and engaging with others in the comment section if you'd like.

There are paid options to expedite the review but submitting your book for a review is free. Paying only allows you to up your priority in the queue.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, please check out my channel and if you'd like, submit your book for a review or send me an email with any questions you may have.

Thanks!

From Stage to Page - Finally Publishing an Anthology of Poetry,"I'm really excited to be pushing this collection of poetry compiled with two other writers, where each poem is accompanied by a photograph taken around the time of the poem's creation.

The book focuses on a number of elements with life on the fringes but primarily: poverty, health, family, love lost, and finding the will to keep going. Personally this project hits home because I dedicated a section of poems to my journey fighting cancer in the past couple years.

I stand by the value of creation and publishing having cathartic and therapeutic value and I'm excited to continue this new journey.

Author Website - Formality or can be casual?,"I have had a website for my works for ages, updated with basics on characters, synopsizes of my stories, and monthly casual author updates (keeps me at it, because I think ""well I can look back at these and see how far I've come"" and a loving homage to my fanfiction days.) and so on, but nothing deep on anything I've written.

Publishing public domain books on Amazon,"I run an independent press and was wanting to do a series of ""classics"" in the public domain. Whether it's profitable or not, hopefully it would make the press look good, and it might bring in more new writers. But before we get too far into this financially, I'm worried that Amazon would reject the books. They say ""We may refuse public domain content that's already available through our program or other retail sites. If a free version of a public domain title is available in our store, we will only publish a differentiated version."" I had an issue where we had a new translation of a bilingual version of ""The Prophet"" (which is a differentiated version), which was clearly in public domain, and it took me months to get through the bots and convince them that I had the rights. 

I see a lot of publishers that put out ""classics"" which aren't differentiated and are available on Amazon. Does anyone know if this is something I should worry about? Or does anyone have any experience with this? Amazon isn't our only outlet for sales, but if we lose that market it might be a lot harder to make money on these books. Any advice or help would be appreciated.",1,0,2022-06-25,simiform,N/A,1.0
"Everyone judges a book by its cover, so why choose one that has nothing to do with your story?"," The literary market, especially the indie one, every day it becomes more competitive. **But how do you get readers connected with your story before they even read the blurb?**  


The best way to stand out in a showcase with countless options is through **an eye-catching cover.** And the covers with exclusive illustrations fulfill this role.  


**Look at your own bookshelf** and look for all the illustrated covers on it, especially those that are among the best sellers. Do you know what makes them special?  


They combine so well with the composition that **they become immortal** in the reader's memory.  


When I develop covers, I always seek to create illustrations that are faithful to the description that the authors imagined for their story and that, at the same time, awaken the readers' desire to dive into that universe.  


As I am also an author, I know well how a cover that combine to the genre of the work increases the chances of  recovering the money invested in a release.  


And about you? Want an illustration that captures the image that only exists in your head to quickly attract your readers?  
Send me a PM so we can discover together how to make this dream possible!

My novel is now in alpha stage. I'm going to spend over a year editing an allegory sci-fi literature.,"Hey there, I'm back from vacation as well as a long five day work week at a warehouse for about three weeks. While I was outside of work, I'm hard at work spending the entire year editing the chapters and allocating my resources toward building a new universe. The new novel I’m working on is Simidolian: The Awakening.

Some context is necessary for my literature, so here is what my novel is meant to be. My goal is to create a sci-fi space opera allegorical literature where it is a metaphor based on two unseen video games; [Star Wars: 1313](https://www.unseen64.net/2019/06/24/star-wars-1313-cancelled/) and [Prey 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey_2). My theme will focus less on crime detectives. It will have a heavy emphasis on psychological thriller, a caper story, and espionage. Since this is meant to be a new IP, I wanted to make a complete origin story that shares little resemblance to The Mandalorian. It follows a marine named Jake Avolsky who stole a bounty by eliminating the Hommodiel’s forces leader name Hommodiel Del Boili. He is selected to take part of a secretive guild called The Simidoian. For his final test, Jake would have to confront a splinter resistance called the Quadia Pather. The Pather Leader is planning to avenge the death of Del Boili. Worse, they are planning to awaken the Pathers cells from their slumber. Launch a rampant terrorist attack toward the United Galactic Frontier and possibly around the galaxy.

My original work started when I first created a very rough novela called Roman: Dead or Alive. This slice of my literature would lead me to create a fully fledged novel sometime in November 2019. My ‘in-development’ stage would not be completed until July 24th, 2021. My work would not transition to ‘alpha’ until March 14th, 2022. My goal for alpha is to begin the long chore editing the entire novel and gear up towards reaching for beta. Doing just that, I’m planning to have a Patreon page and ‘closed alpha’ Discord channel where fellow readers are free to support my work and offer me feedback. There is also a personal [blog page](https://simidolian.com/) I created to showcase my work. You can head on over if you like.

Rather than make a repeat of what J. K. Rowling did to bringing the Harry Potter* to film. I decided that I would take the opposite approach. While I never intended to begin my career in full time writing, my actual interest is planning to be an indie game developer. The intention here is to take all the resources I work on and translate it into its own interactive format as a medium.

That said. I do find it imperative that I need to keep myself up to date on most documents. This will not be limited to worldbuild, but it will include software development, chapters, etc. For the time being, I'll keep most of my material under wrapped for some time.

The Awakening will take place sometimes after an insurgent warfare, called the Kuaddi war. As a rookie Simidolian, Jake Avolsky would have to complete his final test where he would have to sabotage the black market. He would need to hunt down a Quadia Pather leader and stop their reign of terror before the Pathers strike planet Earth. This is going to be the story I want to craft. It will be set in stone. 

Oh, there will be no ‘baby Yoda' appearing in my literature. It will be skewed toward the adult audience.

Like a runner who's about to pick up its feet, I'll get a head start towards editing. Looking forward to beginning the long road ahead.

Any ideas or feedback are welcome.

Attend writers conferences,"There is a lot to learn about the craft of writing. We have read many books but found meeting people at conferences helped more. At a conference you meet literary agents, speakers and peers. Writing is a business, it encompasses many skill sets. We need a lot of support both technically and emotionally. Rejection comes with the territory, often we sit in silence waiting and it can be maddening. Some of the contacts we made at conference have become our support system, friends for years. You will find very few people in the industry will want to help you unless you don't need help. If you have a strong platform, and a book which will sell itself you'll find people in line to help you (this is a rare situation). We have three self published books, self published because we lack a strong platform, we have done book presentations, social media and book signings to promote our work. Writing a book for us is fun, but the silence which follows becomes disheartening, we've won awards at writers conferences and they are a pick me up. It's a nice feeling to receive recognition for your work. Don't expect to earn a living though.",2,0,2022-04-21,Braveknight62,N/A,1.0
My advice for starting out writing books as a published indie author,"Hey guys my name is Shinry. 

I am the author of the Shinry series and the Chronicles of Wayne. I have written 32 books, written over a million words, and publsihed four of the books offiically so far. I know when you first start out writing a book or even a sequel it can be stressful and hard. So the best advice is always to just write. No matter what it is, no matter if it's miss spellings or doesn't make sense now just write. Because the editing comes after the book is done! The reason why just write! sounds so simple is because that's normally the hardest step, just wriitng the words because you're always unsure if it's perfect the first go round. But also when you just start writing, then the real ideas begin to flow, the story comes out and you're writing without even thinking about it. You're seeing the world, hearing your characters and also get a second notepad or use your phone notepad for notes.

&#x200B;

Notes are different from writing the novel is because it's like a major plot points, things to lead up to, quotes a character might say that will come up later or a scene that will be in later chapters. I always plan out my climaxes. 

&#x200B;

The next thing is the 5 step outline: The Beginning, the Escape, The Quest, The ultimate test/battle and the Return. 

&#x200B;

The beginning is when we get to meet your character or characters and learn what his goal is. You can introduce your character anyway you choose to. 

&#x200B;

The escape is how your character leaves his ordinary world and begins his adventure. Think Ash Ketchum going to get his first pokemon and beginning his quest to become a pokemon master. He leaves his home and starts his adventure. Or it can be a villian who attacks and destroys his home and forces the hero to leave to become stronger or search after his loved ones. This is your inticing incident when the story takes off.

&#x200B;

the Quest is the bulk of your book, anything can happen here. This is where you can intrdouce side characters, subplots, side characters with their own motivations, mini bosses etc, the point is though all subplots have to be wrapped up before the climax, unless you're planning sequels in which case this can be used perfectly for foreshadowing. 

&#x200B;

The Ultimate test/battle is your climax! Either an epic battle or a choice between two things, or a truth. It's up to you how epic the reveal is!

&#x200B;

The Return has three types of endings: Sucession, Tragedy and Change of Heart.

Sucession is when your character set off to achieve a goal in the escape and won! Red becoming the Pokemon Champion, capturing all 150 Pokemon. Your character beating the villian, and saving the loved one. 

&#x200B;

Tragedy is when your character set off an adventure from the escape and acheived his goal, but there was a consequence. Infamous is a great example. The entire game you are a hero choice (f you chose it) and you get to a point in the game where: You can save ten doctors or your girlfriend. The obvious choice is to save the doctors at the cost of losing your love. It's a tragic ending...but the right choice.

&#x200B;

And Change of Heart. Your character sets off from the escape with a goal in mind but instead choooses something else. Think of Hercules who set off on his quest to become a God again but in the end when he does become a God, chooses to remain on earth with Meg, the love of his life.

&#x200B;

"New historical crime fiction novel - ""The Devil's Fire"" available on Amazon.","Hope you don't mind but just wanted to post about my new historical crime fiction novel ""The Devil's Fire"" which is available on Amazon (also part of kindle unlimited programme for free). It's the sequel to my first book ""An Ancient Sin"" which was completed last year (also on kindle unlimited).

Both books are set in 1286 in London/Kent England and the summaries are:

* **An Ancient Sin** \- Kent, 1286. The librarian at Aylesford Priory is poisoned and a lay brother, Thomas, is forced by the sub-prior to journey to Rochester in the dead of night. Thrust from his quiet life at the priory, it is not long before Thomas finds himself caught up in a game of death, and murder surrounds him. Rivalries, deceit and ancient evil; the attacks in Rochester continue. Nothing is what it seems, as Thomas struggles to uncover the truth and bring a murderer to justice. Can he solve the mystery or will the hand of death continue to stalk through the town unchecked?
* **The Devil's Fire** \- London, Autumn 1286. A priest is found stabbed to death outside the door of his church. Then, another church is burned to the ground. Rumour quickly spreads that it is the Devil’s Fire, sent to punish the citizens of London for their sins and Thomas and Henry soon find themselves summoned to West Minster, to investigate these terrible events. As they delve deeper into the mystery, they unwittingly find themselves caught up in a tangle of deceit, involving a holy relic, a Templar crusade and the jealousy between kings. Will Henry and Thomas be able to discover the truth, or will the Devil’s fire continue to rage through London, causing unimaginable death and destruction?

Hi everyone,"I'm Patrick Scattergood and I'm the award-nominated author of the Mother, Dearest dark urban fantasy series called Mother, Dearest, described by some as a mix between a cynical Neil Gaiman and Carnival Row as well as called 'gay shit with magic' by a Twitter troll, which has kind of become my badge of honour.

I'm a nonbinary/pansexual author from Leicester, UK. I've written two dark urban fantasy books (Mother, Dearest / The Man Who Died Twice) that make up the first two books in the series. It was nominated for best speculative fiction in the 2021 speculative fiction category by the Queer Indie website. I'm also the co-author of the sci-fi time travel / action adventure called Time to Burn. I wrote that alongside my partner Golda Evans.

In the next couple of weeks, I've got my fourth novel coming out on Amazon so thought I'd take the time to introduce myself.

Sophie Taylor, 24, loves three things: her sister, tea and kinky pain. As the single guardian of 14-year-old Melanie, she works hard and plays hard, navigating being a good sister and a responsible adult every day.

When her sister returns home with a myriad of bruises and a single memory of club Lavender, Sophie feels like a failed parent– and itches to see justice done.

She infiltrates Lavender in search of the culprits and hard evidence to bring them down. Lavender unravels before her with its sumptuous drinks and lavish aesthetic but as she finds an attractive man tied-up in the basement, she uncovers the place has a vicious, depraved side, ready to suck her in.

Alone in a club full of enemies, Sophie struggles to keep sight of her goal. But someone has her back. The Lavender Phantom, an urban legend said to haunt Lavender and help those in need, has taken an interest in her. But can Sophie really trust this mysterious stranger, or is he another hook to drag her deeper into Lavender’s intoxicating danger?

When she learns the life of another child could be destroyed in Lavender’s extravagant rooms, she has to choose – save him or save herself.",0,0,2020-12-24,LaineyDelaroque,N/A,0.5

In case anyone is wondering, I designed my cover on Canva, formatted my manuscript in Word using Amazon's template (highly recommend ordering a proof copy to find your right size and finish). I created a website on Wix, as well as accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit. I've claimed one on YouTube, but I'm not sure I want to invest my rare mommy free time on videos.

After dealing with a toasted computer, I also strongly recommend cloud backups. I try not to think too hard about what I lost. 

My book is called Prove It: Murder In The Mix. It's a cozy mystery, and I'm happy to share it with anyone interested in reading and leaving a review. Here's the synopsis:

*When a tragic mixer mishap results in the closing of a beloved bakery, new mom and upstairs neighbor Stephanie Wu is sure of two things: One, she misses their cappuccinos. And two, it was no accident. But time is running out for the sleep-deprived sleuth. Can she solve the murder and figure out pumping before her maternity leave is up? With a baby at her breast and a killer at her back, life and living above The Likable Daisy will never be the same again.*

DM me or comment if you'd like a free copy. Any constructive criticism is welcome. Thanks for reading my super long post.

Where The Stars Hang by J. L. Young,"Doctor Kodi Paige, a disabled veteran and astrophysicist, is given the opportunity to examine a seemingly normal, but rare meteorite. During the examination, a peculiar capsule is discovered within. Its contents will alter her life as well as the course of humanity.
Paige acquires genetically stored knowledge of an extinct race of people, the Alyk Gal’malym, who were enslaved and slaughtered for the amusement of a reptilian species called the Tye.

Paige is given access to artifacts not native to Earth. During her quarantine, she designs a space battleship, the United Earth Ship Vigilance and a space multi-role combat fighter, the Strix, both built melding human and Alyk Gal’malym technologies.

Dead by Morning (A Dark Supernatural Thriller) is only 99 cents!," ""He was real, and he was a monster.""  


Obsession is deadly.  


No one learns that better than Luna Ketz, a pessimistic high school senior. Caught between the intentions of her stern father and business-minded mother, boys are the last thing on Luna’s mind, but this fact doesn’t detour mysterious bad boy Chance Welfrey from trying to gain her affection. Luna doesn’t think twice about him until girls at their high school begin to disappear. Girls who tended to hurt her.  


Girls she wished would disappear.  


When she receives a call from a long-lost friend, normalcy goes out the window as she’s plunged into the paranormal. There’s a world beneath the surface of the unconscious mind, and the killer knows how to navigate it. Luna is in danger and although she can avoid the killer in reality, she cannot avoid him in her dreams.

Before we adopted her, Gracie spent 1 year in foster care with no applications to before us. Her profile said no dogs, no cats, no children. When we met her, she rolled onto our feet and after a some important conversations we decided to adopt her. Gracie has come a long way since we first met her, she’s more relaxed, playful, and a lot more confident. It's truly been a remarkable experience to adopt this little dog.  


To mark the 5 years of her adoption and as a gift to our new baby we wrote an illustrated children's book to highlight her story. The book highlights Gracie's adoption story and her quest to find a forever home.

My IndieAuthor Experience So Far,"So, when I decided to really pursue writing an actual book it took me around 2 years to write it and complete it. After a arduous experience of writing query letters and all of that bullshit; getting rejection after rejection I decided to publish it myself using Kindle Direct. I've spent the last 8 months promoting it myself and scheduling book signings. 

Around a month and half ago I was invited to an authors showcase honoring local and state authors. All I was told in the email was that o could bring some books to sell and they'd provide a table. Well I get there and find I'm in a banquet hall full of uppity people twice my age dressed like they were going to their own funeral. I was the only person their my age (36) and was wearing a Tool T-shirt with jeans. Also, I was expecting to stand at a podium and talk about my book, which I had no clue I was to do. I wasn't prepared at all. I was the next to the last person to speak out of  maybe 20 people. Everyone ahead of me  had books about spirituality, cooking, historical, or memoir. It was a very distinguished bunch. I get up to speak in my Tool shirt and shaved head, talking about psychotic bad trips, psychotic breakdowns, and gratuitous use of the f word. Needless, to say I wasn't a hit. 

But, I had left my book lying on a table before I went to speak and had forgotten it. A man brought it it to me as I was getting ready to leave, after spending 2 hrs at a table and selling only 1 copy, and he said, ""you left this lying on that table and I've been reading it, I'd like to buy it so I can finish it."" Then he took a card, I thanked him, and he left. A month and a half went by and I haven't thought much at all about that day, until 2 days ago when I received an email from the man who picked up my book telling me that he was a publisher and loved my book. He offered me a deal, which we are to meet and discuss later next week. His only requirement was that cut out a lot of the 'fucks'. 

So, you never know. You have to just do it. Breaks will come. 

The publisher left a pretty cool review on Amazon. I'll post the link if you guys want to read it. It is the very last one.

My question is, should I change my book title???
Everytime I log into KDP, my blocked book stares me in the face and I can't help but wonder, if I don't change it, will it cause my book to be under undue scrutiny from Amazon?

I'm getting ready to drop a lot of money to edit and format again. I'm also having the cover redone as well. So, if I need to change the title, now is the time.

Fellow Indie Author!!,"Hey all, I have two published books and working on a series currently to be published soon! Just want to give advice and help others. I think the best tool for me has been social media from reddit, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. I am always promoting all my work. Currently I just even started my new YouTube channel where I review children's books!

Need your book designed?,"Hi all, I'm a book designer looking to connect with some Indie Authors. I do book covers, interiors, ebooks, and author websites. I have also helped authors publish through KDP, set up giveaways on their blogs and create social media campaigns for their latest book. Check out my portfolio and get in touch if you think we would be a good fit! [http://sjbarnes.com/](http://sjbarnes.com/)",2,1,2019-02-14,sjbarnesdesign1,N/A,1.0
Help us to help you,"I run a website dedicated to Science Fiction and Fantasy literature. We heavily focus on the independent scene of self-published or independent press works. There isn't a lot of coverage for indie authors and there's an amazing amount of highly talented writers that can't even get a story out, so we are trying to help get their work out there!

  
We run news articles and press releases for any new work that we are made aware of, and a weekly author interview slot. I'm working on getting a regular ""Out This Week"" announcement post going, as well. On top of this, we publish a new original piece of SFF fiction every week on the site.  


What I want to know is, what would help you? From the perspective of an author, is there anything in addition to the above that we could be doing to help you guys promote your work?",2,1,2019-02-12,ZealotPete,N/A,1.0

Looking for advice for my independent authors social media network,"It's our intention to become the goodreads of independent authors, however getting people to remain engaged and coming back has been a little harder in recent years. 

www.booktownusa.org is the site we used to be on ning and they seemed a little sketchy to us (hiring prices without providing new features, we believe they were sold to another company) so this time last year we switched to another service, social engine and engagement declined.

We haven't changed much (except members can't stay logged in, I have one member who doesn't like that she can't log in and stay logged in) and that's just one of the concerns. 

If you were to join a network like this to engage with other indie authors what would you like from out of the site runners?

New Horror Novel,"Hey guys, I'm new to this thread, but I just wanted to let you all know that I am an up and coming horror author who has just released his first novel. I figured the people here may be into it, and I need to spread the word as much as I can! It's an incredibly dark and disturbing story about a rural town possessed in evil, cloaked in a curtain of eternal darkness. Something lurks just beyond the eyes of the townspeople, they know something that we don't. When Luke Russell comes to town following some domestic trouble, he becomes determined to figure out what's going on underneath the graveyard. The only one who can help him is a mental patient stowed away in a crooked asylum. Who will survive and will anything be left of them?

It's Halloween season and I know you guys need a spooky read from a fresh author! If you're a fan of someone like Stephen King, then check it out in paperback or ebook format. I included a link to it. Thanks again!

Detailed account of a Kindle Countdown Deal w/costs and results,"Howdy, fellow writers.
I've written a detailed account of a Kindle Countdown Deal, listing promo services I used, costs incurred and results. There aren't that many such accounts on the Net and none that I know of that are recent so I thought this might come in handy to help all you self-publishers out there decide how best to promote your masterpieces.
Read, enjoy and feel free to leave comments, I love feedback (don't we all).

"Indie Authors--hi, I'm Matt. May I offer an idea? I'll review your Amazon eBook if you review mine. Not self-promoting, and no links. Just making this offer...","1st reviews are hard to get. We can help each other! My book's .99 cents; I can send a free copy (will need email), or buy mine, I'll buy yours (if .99) so we can boost one another and raise sales!

I am not posting a link to my book, as per the rules of this subreddit.  And I'm not just posting for self-promotion but rather to offer a solution which is mutually beneficial. It IS scary in the self-publishing world, because you cannot get your work even seen without unconventional tactics.  
If this post makes it without being deleted (please?), I'd like permission to post at least the name of my book.  I even have a blog where I'm posting free chapters to review before agreeing to my proposal... 
Thank you, I hope the idea is appealing!

Regarding semi-autobiographical writing,"If I, say, publish a book with several stories from my life and people I know, what are the requirements for privacy?
Do I just change their names and locations and that will cover it? Any suggestions as to how I should alter the nonfiction to protect others from embarrassment, or me from being sued?
Also, could I just use a pseudonym, can you use pseudonyms and will that prevent litigation? 

It will be a first for me to write a novel, and I am quite ignorant of publishing policies. I was hit with the brilliant idea to transform a period of my life to writing, then as I started jotting down stories I realized how absurd and embarrassing and illegal they would be. Which I am fine being associated with myself, but I'm sure the others involved wont be. Help is muchmuchmuch appreciated. Gracias!",2,9,2011-02-14,annde,N/A,1.0
