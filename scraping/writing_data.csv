Mainstream writing advice makes my writing cringe,"I was rereading the latest draft I wrote a month ago, and I remember when I was writing it I used a lot of mainstream writing advice (in terms of sentence composition, atmosphere, voice, etc.) Taking this advice to face value made me experience what I had never before; I struggle to read what I wrote because it makes me cringe. It feels like I lost my voice and my writing sounds generic. 

Here‚Äôs an excerpt (translated because I write in Spanish): 

> Senka shouted another incantation, and the mist swirled around the wounded boy, protecting him. The holgh searched around with wild eyes like a rabid animal. Its face contorted; crooked fangs protruding from its mouth, eyes about to bulge out from its skull. It was the most gruesome thing Lia had ever seen‚Äîand she had even seen death. 
> She raised the sword and stroke the holgh‚Äôs back as hard as she could. Ichor splattered its face, but as soon as the sword broke the skin, the wound healed as if it had never happened. The holgh raised a claw to slash at her, and Lia leaped to the side, barely evading it. 

I don‚Äôt know what it is about it, the fact that *I* wrote it or the fact that the scene isn‚Äôt perfect yet, but I find myself not being excited at all. If this was someone else‚Äôs book, it wouldn‚Äôt captivate me. However, if I wrote emotionally in the way I used to when I was just starting, it would read something like this: 

> Senka‚Äôs voice reached Lia, *another spell*, expecting no effect again. But the mist rose from nowhere and swirled around her and the boy, covering them from the monster. The holgh‚Äôs wild eyes searched around desperately, like a rabid animal, bulging out from its skull. It had a contorted, distorted face; something more from a nightmare than from reality, with crooked fangs protruding on its mouth, more gruesome than death. 
Lia raised the sword and stroke down, hitting its back as hard as she could. Ichor splattered everywhere, even Lia‚Äôs face, but as soon as the edge of the sword broke the skin it healed. Lia blinked in disconcertment. ‚ÄúFuck‚Äù she muttered before the holgh raised a claw to slash at her face. Lia leaped to the side, barely evading it. She didn‚Äôt realize a thin line of blood dropped from her cheek.

What do you do when your first draft is done?,All the articles and advice things I've read say to leave your draft for at least a few weeks if not a few months so that you can come back to it with a clear head and a fresh set of eyes. But those same articles than say to keep writing during that break so you can continue building your creative muscles. That advice feels contradictory for me especially since the book I'm writing is the first part of a trilogy. I'm nearing the end of my first draft for my first book and am a little bit lost. Should I start writing book two during my break even though I could end up changing aspects of book one during my structural edits or should I try to find something else to write even though I'm going to have to leave it when I finish my book one edits so I can continue the trilogy? What have you guys done when you finish your first draft? ,3,15,2025-09-25,RollForCurtainCall,Advice,1.0
Am I going insane? Are these all the sentences in existence?,"Hey all! I'm 30k deep in a fiction project (my day job is as a content writer, so the style is very different), and I feel like I can't choose more than, like, three types of sentences. Surely there are more:

He \[blanked\], \[blanking\] his/the/whatever \[blank\] (e.g., ""he stood, pulling his jacket from the chair"")

He \[blanked\] and \[blanked\] (e.g., ""He snatched the papers and slammed them on the table"")

With a \[something\], he \[blanked\] OR, similarly, he \[blanked\] with a \[something\] (e.g., ""With a chortle, he accepted the shoddy drawing"" OR ""He tossed the paper in the trash with a huff"")

There's... more, right? Like why does it seem like these are the only sentences that exist? (I mean yeah, there's your basic ""He did X"" and ""Y happened"" and a couple variable phrases you can start with, e.g., if \[blank\] and while \[blank\], etc.). But how do you break out of the patterns to see other phrasing options when, obviously if you saw them, you would be using them? I've tried scanning through other fiction.

I guess, does anyone have recommendations for authors with varied prose that works well (aside from the obvious Le Guin) and isn't leaning super hard into lit fic? Am I just overthinking this?",44,72,2025-09-24,SableDragonRook,N/A,0.77
"I've created a character, but now I don't know whether they belong in a story.","The basic gist of what's going on is that for a while now, I've been creating and curating a character. Or, more specifically, a monster. I've built my own fictional apex predator down from its most primitive roots and biological structure to where it stands in its future. I've put a lot of thought and effort into the species, and I'm proud of it. But the thing is, I initially conceptualised this creature without any intention of incorporating them into a plot or novel, my reasoning being that the spotlight would be taken away from the creature and its fundamentals, which are core parts that I've fleshed out. I never intended for it to get as detailed as it got.

I have the idea to create a stand-alone story in the form of either:

1. A diary entry from a hiker or explorer stalking the creature, trying to understand it (a log of 'Day 1, Day 2,' type of things).
2. A scientific report from an expert doing research on the creature and its history (filled with diagrams, graphs, and all things in-depth).

I think both of these are optimal approaches for fixating on the creature as the main character, but I'm having a hard time deciding on which. I probably won't do a full on scientific report because I don't want the burden of making it valid, accurate, etc, so I'll likely to a pseudo-report from the perspective of someone not quite a scientist, but someone out for exposing the creature for what it is, thus allowing humanity to protect themselves and mobilise. As for the first one, I'm afraid it'll become too simple - just a guy logging things without any baseline validity (because the creature's history and biology are also interesting findings - how could a lowly explorer discover things that major and old?).

I'll figure it out, but for now, which one would you guys be more interested in reading?",0,1,2025-09-25,Upbeat_Chance6402,Advice,0.5
Videos or books on rewriting?,"I want to get better at rewriting my drafts.

I've (almost) finished my first novel! Here's my process,"This morning I finished running through the fourth round of edits for my novel! Whew! I am so close to being done I can almost taste it! And I wanted to share what the process had been like from start to finish, both as a way to celebrate (in a strange way perhaps) this milestone and as a reference for myself going forward. This is my first book and the whole thing has been a never ending process of having no idea what I'm doing, finding something that works, doing it, and then being back in a position of not knowing what I'm doing. LOL. 

I haven't even started on any of the steps towards publication. This is just how I got to a point where I think that the manuscript might be ready for querying. My manuscript is LGBTQ literary fiction, about 70K words. 

Draft 0: Brainstorming/Plotting 

* I started with a very general sense of what I wanted the story to be about: A queer coming of age story focused on the changing relationship between a mother and daughter as the daughter navigates discovering her sexuality in the context of a conservative, Catholic community. 
* Planning out my characters came next. For each character, I tried to figure out:
   * **What is their main goal? What do they want in this story?**
      * I feel like this was the most important question to answer for all of my characters because it ensured that they were active, i.e. that they did things rather than let things happen to them. 
   * Next to figuring out my character's goals, **figuring out the central tension in their lives was the second most important part of developing my characters. I wanted every character to deal with a fundamental contradiction that would have to be resolved by the end of the book.** For example, my MC wants to discover herself but also wants to appease her family. The plot of the book is centered on how these two opposing wants will be reconciled (or not!)
   * What is their physical appearance? Sex/gender, age, ethnicity, appearance, style, etc. 
   * What is their social background? Class, occupation, education, family life, religion, nationality, culture, place in community, politics, hobbies, etc.
   * What is their psychological life like? What are their morals, what are their romantic relationships like, what are their ambitions and disappointments, what is their temperament, their attitude towards life, their neurosis and psychological complexes (at this point I was doing a degree in philosophy and reading a lot of Freud, sorry!), how smart are they, what are they good at?
   * What are their relationships with other characters and how do these relationships change over the course of the book?
      * Much to my embarrassment, I actually drew little pictures of my characters and put lines between them to explain their relationships. 
* Themes: These developed from the characters and the tensions that they grapple with throughout the book. 
* After planning out my characters, I had a sense of A) what they want to achieve over the course of the story and 2) what tension needs to be resolved by the end of the book. This allowed me to have a sort of start and end point which I then used to plot out the main story beats. 
   * I used a classic three act story arc to do this. I started by deciding what my inciting incident would be and what my resolution would be. Then I filled in the climax and developed scenes that would lead from the inciting incident to the climax and then from the climax to the resolution. I found it really helpful to draw out an arc and place each scene on it.
* Setting: This was pretty much established from the get-go. I always knew I would want to have the story set in the neighborhood where I grew up. So in terms of world building, there wasn't much I had to do here. I did do some really fascinating historical research at the public library and went on a lot of walks. 

Draft 1: Getting my ideas on paper

* In hindsight, this was almost like writing an outline for an essay - just less formal. Basically, my task for my first draft was to get all the scenes down, regardless of whether or not the writing was good or made sense. Literally I closed by eyes and wrote. When I got to a scene that I didn't feel ready to write, or whenever I felt like I had writer's block, I switched from proper prose to bullet points, jotted down what I wanted to happen in that section, and then moved on. 
* These scenes were so skeletal. Character A and Character B are in Setting Y. Character A does Z. Character B responds in X way. 
* This left me with a big mess :) 

Draft 2: ""Colouring in""

* Draft 1 gave me a skeleton. Draft two was about fleshing it out. 
* The first thing I did was go back to the parts that were in bullet points and actually write those as proper scenes. 
* Then I went through and added sensory details, my character's thoughts, descriptions, etc. I would describe draft 1 as almost like a set of stage directions, whereas draft 2 was like watching the play.

\*\* Drafts 0-2 took four years to get through. And they took on so many different forms. Even though I'm laying it out like this, it wasn't really a linear process. As I wrote, my characters took on unexpected dimensions, I added new plot points and story lines, and things that I had planned out before took on new meanings. So, to be honest, the process was more like, brainstorming, drafting, brainstorming, drafting, colouring in, drafting, brainstorming, drafting, etc. But in the end I got something that looked like a book. 

Draft 3: Making it make sense

* At this point, I printed out the document and read it cover to cover, as though I was a reader of the book and not an author. I found SO MANY plot holes and SO MANY things that made no sense at all. Like there were paragraphs I wrote in first person when the majority of the book is in third person. I changed character names halfway through. Things happened that weren't connected to other things. Scenes were out of order. 
* I fell into a deep depression and laid on my couch for six months moping :( 
* Then I went in and moved things around, fixed up the plot holes and the inconsistencies. 
* This was by far the hardest, most tumultuous time I had in the process of writing this book. I felt so much self doubt and self loathing. Oh well. I got through it I guess. 

Draft 3.5: Sharing it with others

* When the book finally made sense, I shared it to get feedback. I shared it with people I know and love who did not give me great feedback, and with someone I found online through r/BetaReaders who DID give me great feedback. 
* While other people read my book, I did another read through on my own and made a long list of things that I wanted to change. Line editing kind of changes.
   * A lot of these were small things like... this person was sitting in the sentence before. This room is supposed to be above the dining room, not the living room. Is this character blonde or brunette? Whereas the feedback I received from others was more substantive.
* At this point I also took advantage of the lull in writing to do a bit more local history research. 

Draft 4: Incorporating Feedback

* Self explanatory. I edited based on the feedback I received from my beta reader and the list of things that I noticed on my own. I also used the historical research I did to fix any inaccuracies. 
* The feedback that I received prompted me to write a few extra scenes to fill in the gaps that people pointed out. To incorporate them effectively, I wrote down every scene on a sticky note and taped them to my wall. Then I moved them around to visualize where the new scenes would fit in the best. 
   * Endless gratitude to my long suffering partner who put up with living in a house that looks like it is inhabited by a crazy conspiracy theorist. 
* At this point, I also decided it was time to get rid of all my overused words. I went through the document and got rid of every ""suddenly,"" ""really,"" and ""just."" 

Draft 5: Copy edit

* This I have yet to do. But I'm excited. I'm hoping that I won't see any more glaring issues with the manuscript as I edit for grammar. If I do, I guess it's back to step four until it's good enough. Sigh. 
* Will most likely rely pretty heavily on the *Elements of Style* as I go through to make sure all my sentences work... Any other copy editing resources you can think of? I'd appreciate it : )

\*\* Drafts 3-4 have taken maybe... a year? Who knows how long copy editing will take.

Thank you for reading all the way through! This was so helpful to type out, as it has been such a back and forth process for me. Now I'm going to... have a drink or two?",28,6,2025-09-24,summertimealison,Other,0.91
Annoying: Trouble with filling out my stories and slowing down the pace,"Despite being someone with a love of meandering books with a ton of flavour text (eg ASOIAF, LOTR, Wheel of Time), I find that my stories are just way too lean and fast-paced. Maybe it's my love of speedrunning showing through, but I'm always going from one plot point to another, and all the characterization I do, I tend not to reiterate over. I think this might be a consequence of my very structured method of writing, but the problem is that it doesn't allow you to linger in the world and take in the surroundings. I try to fill them out, but again I start thinking too structurally whenever I take pen to paper, and get too bogged down on which details to include and which to omit, how to set up each scene, etc. I think thats because I think too much about how the world and the text is built and how it moves, rather than just living in it, which is something I struggle to do IRL as well",5,6,2025-09-24,AntiSaudiAktion,Discussion,0.69
Improve in Narrative,"I really enjoy role-playing games, especially those that focus on building a deep and engaging story. Once, I played a one-shot at a convention where the Game Master did an exceptional job with the narrative. Even though it was improvised around the players‚Äô actions, the story felt cohesive and captivating, and we were all amazed by the experience.

After the session, I approached him to ask for some advice. He told me he was a literature professor, and that his approach was to give players freedom while gently guiding certain aspects or scenes. That way, the story could develop proper shape, structure, and most importantly: a satisfying conclusion. Otherwise, he said, the narrative risked becoming directionless.

He recommended that I should study narrative structures.i only know the basic and linear one.  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt ask him where to start or what books he would suggest. Maybe someone here could help point me in the right direction?

Printing a book?,"So for context - when I was a kid, I'd write like it was my job, and my sister was always drawing. Our mom would tell us someday she hoped we'd publish a book that I wrote and she illustrated.

This year for her birthday, I decided it was time for that to happen and I wrote up a blurb, sent it to my sister and she is illustrating it. She is doing all of it digitally, so I am wondering if anyone here might know a good source to have our silly little gift printed out for my mom. We only would want 1-3 copies I'm guessing, so I don't want a bulk printing company. I've looked things up but I don't know the best route to take for this.

I'm actually doing it.,"I'm a professional TV writer who has managed to make a more than decent living up until this year (strike+ industry contraction). I started the year with 2 TV projects that fell through within the first months and then found myself in a situation where I was getting no leads, no movement, nothing solid, nothing on the horizon. Cue: crisis mode. Doesn't help that I'm 42. Or that I became a new mom last year. Or that I lived like I thought I was always going to be financially okay. Anyway, call it midlife crisis, I started panicking: Is my career over? What will I do to provide for my family? Do I even have any marketable skills? What is my purpose? How can I give my life meaning if I can't be what I've defined myself as for so long?

Truth is, I haven't found the answer to most of those questions,  and it's going to take a lot of therapy I currently can't afford to figure it out, but whenever I'm in an acute crisis (which is often these days), my wife always says: Forget about the money, what do you actually want to do? And the only answer I can muster is that I still want to write. So...write, she always responds. 

And so here I am...sharing this here because I'm not ready to share IRL: I'm writing. Despite my intense insecurities about whether or not I'm capable of being a Writer with a capital W, despite the fact that I know that while finding success in my career path is already hard (I'm living proof of it, I'd already ""made it""), writing books and finding success is that much harder, despite the fact that I know that while I have the upper hand (a privilege that I'm very grateful for) and I might just find someone interested in publishing, that doesn't mean I'll find readers (which is hard on the ego when you're used to writing things that attract millions of eyeballs)...I'm writing. 

Not just 1 manuscript but 2, a memoir reflecting on this little midlife crisis I'm going through, and a YA speculative fiction novel.

And it's frustrating and hard and lonely and scary, but I'm not going to stop until I can type ""THE END.""

Books that pulls off a fake protagonist opening?,"I've been considering a story idea with a fake protagonist, a teenager about to set out on a seemingly stereotypical whimsical fantasy adventure. But then they go missing, and the story follows their mentors instead as they figure out what happened to the kid.

But as much as I like the idea, the obvious pitfall is obvious. I'm worried that I'll sell the audience on the wrong protagonist and that people will just get annoyed if I swap to a different perspective. The only books I can think of that pulled this off are ones like Game of Thrones and murder mysteries, but they tend to kill the opening pov character off very quickly.

How do I identify if my writing is too melodramatic and borderline pretentious and cringey or elevated and powerful?,"Is it just context? For example, if the book you're writing is naturally literary leaning so lines like ""His fingertips seared like the Summer of 89' where memories of my innocence are a blur...blah blah blah"" are okay? Or is that too melodramatic and cringey if you suddenly see it in a book where there's nothing like it in previous chapters and the writer hasn't established the kind of style in the beginning? My novel is leaning toward the literary side but sometimes I write these lines and read them and I think they're okay (even pat myself on the back thinking I just wrote a brilliant line) but when I go on and live my life, sometimes I would encounter a quote from any social media app and be like ""ugghhh blegh that's so dramatic"". Why do I react like that? How do you draw the line? Is there even a way to know? Thank you!

EDIT: Summary of what I got from the commenters thank you!

1. It's probably okay to have that line ""he felt the insidious dread of the Swedish cow, from which the hide was sourced, as the bag stretched and pressed across his shoulders, its suffering now outliving the asthmatic coughs and curses of the freckled farmer."" if its justified and adds some layer and has context. You can't just go off on tangents when all it does is increase your word count for no reason. (that's not a real line in my novel just an example and find it somewhat cringe because no context or not? hence my conundrum)
2. Writing groups and/or beta readers are helpful but probably at a stage you are comfortable. They provide fresh eyes because we always look at our creation like they're the pinnacle of creation.
3. It's okay if it reads as melodramatic and pretentious. That's what revisions are for. You go over rounds until you distill it into a compact and tight experience for your readers.
4. You don't have to go over your way to describe every little thing in the scene. Knowing which things in the scene deserve a space in your sentences is another skill I guess? Use metaphors and similes and the like like garnishes(?)

What tools do you use to see your book in book form before submission?,"TLDR I know I will submit my proposal in Word doc form but I want to also see my cookbook in book form during the drafting stage and I am curious what tools other writers recommend.

I know the industry standard is to submit proposals and manuscripts as Word docs and that is what I will be doing when I query. But as I am finishing my cookbook manuscript I find it really helpful to see the book in book form instead of just a Word file.

I am leaning toward tools like Scrivener Atticus or Reedsy‚Äôs free editor because they let you drop in images or placeholders and preview page layouts. Since it all gets exported to Word anyway for agents or editors this is mostly for my own process. It keeps me motivated and helps me visualize flow length and balance between recipes voice sections and photos.

My questions
	1.	What tools or software do you use to see your manuscript as a book during the drafting phase
	2.	For cookbook or heavily visual projects do you recommend Scrivener vs Atticus vs Reedsy or something else entirely

The Bechdel Test,"Some thoughts on a test that was never meant to be a test. In the original iteration of this, it came from a gag comic where one of the characters, a lesbian, would only go to movies where two women talk about something besides a man so she could imagine they were lesbians secretly involved in a steamy romance behind the scenes. I want to give some thoughts on what the Bechdel Test accomplished as a serious form of critique, and what that means for writers.

**The Good**

I think the Bechdel Test as an honest form of literary critique drew attention to formulaic stories with a certain type of main character- the ""James Bond"" trope, so to speak. There's nothing inherently wrong with writing an accomplished, skilled male protagonist who winds up in a lot of short romantic encounters with women. That is a character, he has a drive (save the world) and a flaw (easily seduced by women), which could conflict. The issue is when this character is meant to ride off the success of another character, simplifying what could be a complex and sincere character into uncreative tropes, you have a problem, especially if this character is primarily speaking to female characters and evil villains, and neither get a sincere chance to be a character because they're catering to a copy and paste version of what could have been a flawed human being. I can't say it's an entirely good faith review, but it is a symptom of a larger problem of power fantasy storytelling.

**The Bad**

You cannot treat the Bechdel Test as a must-do. In some cases, it's near impossible. For example, writing a book about soldiers in World War 1, you'll naturally mostly encounter male characters. Additionally, writing in first person as a male character, you'll see the world through their eyes, and while he might just be around while two women are talking (which... is true for everyone except for Mihailo Tolotos), those conversations might not be relevant for the current situation. A fast-paced action story might not have time for idle chitchat between characters aside from the MC barking out orders, or others barking orders to him, a political thriller might have any given female character, working in the government, talking about male politicians since politics in many countries have not discovered that women can do paperwork and pass laws too.

Using it as a form of literary critique is also a bit flawed. Sure, many stories fail the Bechdel Test, but they're good stories that just... don't have a lot of female characters. I believe Lord of the Rings fails, Dante's Divine Comedy definitely fails (since it's largely Dante talking to one person at a time), Journey to the West fails (unless you consider protagonists changing bodies and genders whenever it's convenient. The horse seems to be female, maybe, but doesn't really talk).

**Conclusion**

I don't actually think power fantasies are inherently bad, I just think they need to come from a place of sincerity in some way. Like anything, the best stories aren't formulaic, they come from experience and passion. Write a power fantasy but write a power fantasy about something you sincerely care about. The story of the greatest fisherman to ever walk the planet. The story of a quilter who clothed a city. The story of a video game champion who could not be defeated. The story of a scriptwriter who took on Hollywood itself with indie films and won. Write your love.

The Bechdel test doesn't stand as a strong opposition to stories about men. It stands as an opposition to stories where characters are not written sincerely, a place where you read stories that pigeonhole both the male and female characters into defined roles that don't account for any of the author's real thoughts, simply because they figured this will sell. It might, but it won't be remembered as art.",0,25,2025-09-25,TenPointsforListenin,Discussion,0.32
Where does your story come from??,"Maybe this will sound super weird to some but~

Do you ever feel like your stories and characters come from somewhere that's just next to your own imagination.

Like, sometimes I feel like I'm tapped into a world that wants you all to know about it and I'm able to drop myself into the story and discover it rather than purposely choose what happens.

I get surprised by the things my characters do and I'm like ""oh shitttt"" when they do.

Additionally, for some reason I have a filter for my ideas. The Really Good ones make me cry even if it's not inherently emotional.

For example I was workshopping one of my characters who is a fantasy fighter axe weilder  and they were supposed to fight this bad guy I had plans for them to interact with and when I finally got there my axe guy seemed to refuse the fight and after experiencing that it's like - if made them fight it would be wrong???

Super weird but it happens every time I write and sometimes when I draw",23,56,2025-09-23,RascoValor,N/A,0.93
"Shorten, cut or just go for 200k words","Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm currently writing my first longer piece of fiction that I might want to publish later. It‚Äôs part one of an epic fantasy trilogy. Or that was the plan.¬†

My world is complex, it has a system of elemental powers that want to be explained and explored, lots of characters from different cultures, gods with personalities, a complicated history and the people‚Äôs religious interpretation of it. There‚Äôs the usual amount of twists and turns and intrigues and secrets. And it‚Äôs ‚Äúunfortunately‚Äù all important because the plot of the whole series is built around all those details. My worldbuilding is not a background for the plot, it's an essential part of it.¬†

The problem is, it‚Äôs all getting much, much too long. I keep going back and cutting out parts, shortening chapters and descriptions. But it still keeps getting longer than I had planned. I‚Äôm at two thirds of the plot right now, and I have 120k words. And the deeper I get into it, the more things find I need and want to add. 

People tell me that a debut novel shouldn‚Äôt have more than 120k or 150k, and I‚Äôm drifting towards 200k+.¬†

¬†

So what do I do?

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Ignore that guideline and just write however much I want?¬†

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Cut off part of book 1 to put it in book 2, ruining the structure?¬†

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Try to shorten it as much as possible, cutting away things in book 1 that build the foundation for the larger conflict in book 2 and 3, but aren‚Äôt necessary for book 1‚Äôs plot?¬†

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Make it a series of more shorter books (like 9 x 50k-75k)? That might work for the structure again, but feels like cheating. Would people read that?¬†

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Or does anyone have a better solution for me?¬†",0,30,2025-09-24,Maximum_Function_252,Discussion,0.43

Does publishing a book feel like exposing your mind too much?,"Hi All, this is my first time posting in this group.

I self-published my debut romance novel 5 months ago. At first, it was pure excitement; seeing my story out in the world felt like a dream come true.

But lately, I‚Äôve been thinking about something kind of‚Ä¶ creepy. Now, anyone can just *open the book and read what was inside my mind*. The emotions, the tropes, the little details that came from my heart; they‚Äôre all out there, for strangers to analyze, love, or even judge.

It‚Äôs such a strange mix: I feel proud, but also deeply exposed. Like my inner world isn‚Äôt mine alone anymore.

Does learning more about writing slow you down?,"Currently beta reading for some of my relatives (and they are pretty young, 16 and 18). They are horrible, but passionate about this joint writing project they have, and as an honorary aunt, I‚Äôm just reading and having fun with it. As a writer though, I know they are lacking a lot. They know how to progress from A to B, but don‚Äôt really understand the idea of a plot. Their characters for the most part have personality and motivation, but are inconsistent and one dimensional. And of course the writing is cliched and very amateurish. 

I know I should give them proper advice instead of sugar coating it, but the truth is, I know if they quit this now to learn the fundamentals of writing, they won‚Äôt finish it. I would rather they learn the value of finishing a shitty story, and I keep asking them for more to motivate them to write another chapter, but I know if I don‚Äôt tell them, they‚Äôll figure [their lack of skill] on their own and will go and research themselves how to improve.

This I fear will only lead them to start learning, and reading tips on writing, and reading books etc. Which will only lead to disappointment and shame when they read their current story right now.

Requesting Advice on Sharing my perhaps Antiquated Poetry,"Hello all, I am interested in sharing my poetry publicly and would appreciate your advice on this as fellow writers.

My style and subject matters seem to differ from those of ""contemporary"" works, which makes me question how I am to ""break in"", as I have yet to release anything publicly. I've tried to give modern poetry a chance in my reading, but I've failed to connect with it due to its overly subjective, illogical and, at times, salacious qualities. I love poetry because it brings clarity and apprehension into the otherwise messy, mutable, and overwhelming human experience by leveraging the richness of such ostensibly ""dark"" or ""perplexing"" qualities, and with it the richness of language, to illuminate the warmest insights into our shared human condition. Such clarity and apprehension, however, I find to be lackluster in the modern works I've read.

Admittedly, the modern works lack any authority to help my heart open up to what each unknown author has to say; whereas the ""classical"" works, which I am alone inspired by, possess the highest authority in being supported by later great classical writers (for example, I was only able to ""discover"" Shakespeare after having learned that James Joyce, whose works I admired prior to Shakespeare, himself admired Shakespeare more than any other writer; and Plato I found through Percy Bysshe Shelley's authority, and Edmund Spenser through Milton's authority, etc.).

My dream scenario would be for my own work to gain the interest or attention of a notable literary figure whom I admire (like Ralph Waldo Emerson ""discovered"" Walt Whitman), for this is the only certifiable way to gain the trust of readers. Even if this sounds like an improbable dream, no such ""authorities"" seem to exist today, at least in my limited view; thus it is actually an¬†*impossible*¬†dream. For, as I mentioned it is purely the works of ""classical"" writers who are no longer with us today that I look up to as authorities.

Such is my little conundrum, yet I remain hopeful due to the advancements of technology that make the necessity of an ""authoritative figure"" in being discovered now obsolete. The internet should, I hope, give people the chance to see my work, even if it lacks the co-sign of an ""authority"" which I so desire to have in my impossible dream. So the question is: how do I get people to see it in the first place?

Since I hardly keep up with modern poetry, I don't entirely know how it is disseminated. I understand that there are various journals, websites, and magazines, so perhaps that might be a good place to start? I would also like to start doing audio versions of my works to help reach more people and to better articulate the feelings expressed. I am uninterested in selling or marketing my work, which might make self-publishing difficult, but this yet I refuse. The commercialization of art, in general, is something I am averse to. I simply want my work to be seen.

‚ÄúStealing others' work?‚Äù,"[Just a quick introduction. My name is Matthew. I'm a 15 year old writer from the Philippines. 

-

I've only started my work in January of 2024, starting with small stories. However, I've now moved to expanding my work far beyond a page of a book.]

So I've now been writing my Novel for quite some time now, beginning since January of 2025. I've written a few chapters on my other phone (Which I unfortunately lost all of it). I've now since recycled and reused what was left of my Novel after I sent some Screenshots to my older phone before my new phone got demolished by me having an absolute stupid brain forgetting everything for a sudden.

Would that be a good way to plot my story or should I just include both plot lines in one story?

After a bit of time working there, I began writing my first novel in 2012.¬† It was an odd experiment, written as a memoir first with a sci-fi story framework second.¬† So essentially ‚Äì a space adventure, but all the characters are based on real people and most of the memories are true.¬† It‚Äôs janky, but I still have fond memories of writing it.¬† It‚Äôs the start of my universe after all.

From here, I enjoyed writing so much that it became addictive.¬† (Not in any detrimental way.¬† I never let it get in the way of my relationships, health, or work.)

My biggest accomplishment is having written 38 novels in a decade.¬† I have pride in them even if they are still essentially unknown.¬† They are my treasures.¬† The style I enjoy the most is first person present tense to really allow the reader to inhabit the lives and worlds of the protagonists, so I‚Äôve stuck with it.¬† I‚Äôve never claimed to be the best writer around (even though I might be one of the fastest ‚Äì my quickest novel being 200 pages written in 7 straight days.).¬† But my stories are still skillful and fun for what they are doing.¬† I produce competent work.¬† (I‚Äôm satisfied with all but one of my books.)¬† A big factor from there is just if people enjoy my writing style, story premises, and characters.¬† Because not every story will be for everyone.¬† It‚Äôs something that all writers have to come to terms with.

\---

With my methods, I didn‚Äôt have to sacrifice any quality to reach the speeds that feel natural for how devoted I became to my characters and stories.

If you‚Äôre ever overwhelmed with the idea of finishing a book, here‚Äôs the pacing method I use when I‚Äôm getting invested in writing a story:

\- 10 pages a day for 30 days = 300 pages.

\[This works well if you have a lot of free time.¬† Sometimes I go far beyond 10 if I can‚Äôt get enough of the story.\]

\- 6 pages a day for 60 days = around 300 pages (360).

\[A good middle ground if you want to take your time, but get it done quickly enough.\]

\- 3 pages a day for 90 days = around 300 pages (270).

\[You can do what you can here and there with an easy pace if you don‚Äôt have a lot of free time.\]

\- Or you can use one of these equations to write a shorter 200-page book.

\[These can be very liberating and fun due to their smaller scope.\]

I often tell people that I think that everyone should try to write at least one book in their life. ¬†Even if they never publish it.¬† It‚Äôll become a special artifact for their family and friends.¬† They get to immortalize a part of themselves (even if it‚Äôs totally fiction) for the future.¬†

\---

However, as much as I adore creating stories, the biggest struggle (and abject pain) in the writing process has been actually getting noticed.

So far, I have not attracted the attention of any publishers.¬† I used to do so much research to find the agents who could be the best fits for my work.¬† I spent hours crafting query letters.¬† But after a decade, I‚Äôve barely sent my work out to them anymore.¬† After struggling for so long, defeat can set in and the will to keep trying can decay.¬† It becomes too soul-draining, especially when life throws other more serious problems in your way to steal your focus.

So I‚Äôve just been self-publishing them online this whole time.¬† But sadly, not many people found my work organically.

I‚Äôve always been great at completing creative projects.¬† My devotion to seeing things through is intense and obsessive.¬† I just have zero understanding of how to market myself in a way that actually convinces people that my work has value.¬† (I also don‚Äôt have the funds to market them like a larger writer could.)

As a small indie creator across multiple forms of media, I am constantly plagued by the paradox of not understanding how to get people to know that my work exists if I‚Äôm often not allowed to let them know that it exits.¬† It is paralyzing.¬† My life feels like a living catch 22.

I know a few of my books are not for mass market appeal or mass public consumption (\*cough\* ‚Äì cannibal regenerator romance \*cough\*).¬† I wrote those weirder books because I wanted to.¬† And I know a few of my novels are experiments on strange topics.¬† But I like to think I know which ones are my best.¬† (Oddly enough, my erotic monster romance is the one that sold a few copies over the years.¬† I suppose it shouldn‚Äôt surprise me though since it serves a particular niche.)

At the end of the day, I know that I put too much into my books ‚Äì I hollowed myself out for them.¬† My self-worth became inextricable at a certain point.¬† And it hits especially harder after all those years when I barely get any readers (even out of the people in my life).¬† Five people I know have given my stories a chance, but they were able to enjoy them (and make suggestions to improve them which I followed through with).¬† A stranger once also reached out on Reddit to thank me for my contribution to their life, which was nice and we had a conversation about writing, but it ended at that.

A dream of mine is to have a small fanbase that appreciates my stories and characters, draws fanart of them, and debates which novels they think are my best and worst.¬† I think it‚Äôs a shame when people don‚Äôt get to interact with an author while they‚Äôre still here.¬† It is a tragic loss of possibility.¬† And it corrodes me more and more each day to think that I might never get to have this experience.

\---

From late 2024 until now, my life has become more stressful than it ever has been.¬† So I put writing novels aside to prevent myself from getting distracted and lost in the fantasy since I know how I can get once I start.¬† But I‚Äôve barely made any progress towards sorting out these real problems due to a heavy despair that crept in with these issues.¬† I badly miss writing them and it probably wasn‚Äôt healthy to drop a creative outlet like this that seemed to always help my morale.¬† So I recently took some time to write a side-story continuation for some characters from my novels.¬† It was supposed to be short, but I got so into it that I ended up with 144 pages over the 4 days I sat down to write.¬† (Heh.  I can't help myself.)

Anyway, I‚Äôm at a point in my life where I feel more lost than ever.¬† I‚Äôm not sure if me sharing this can help anyone else.¬† If so, then that‚Äôs good.

Even though my main series of novels has reached a conclusion, I have an outline set aside for if I ever wanted to continue it.¬† I think I need to start that story.¬† This might be the time for it.¬† It might not be able to be any other time but now.",3,14,2025-09-22,spawnoftyphon,N/A,0.56
opinion on giving characters names that don‚Äôt match their ethnicity?,"So I have this one character and a name that just fits. I was imagining the world I‚Äôm writing when the character and their name instantly came into my head, clear as day. Problem is their first name isn‚Äôt ethnically accurate, so much so that some letters in the name don‚Äôt even exist in that language.

I value representation like no other when it comes to my story telling, so I‚Äôve been trying to find a more accurate name that exists in that language but none of them fit the way this name does. 

For context, my book is a contemporary romance and the character is an ethnicity that isn‚Äôt my own which is why I‚Äôm more adamant on naming them properly. 

Any advice or opinions?  ",0,9,2025-09-23,gojoandgetospet,N/A,0.27

First Steps of a Writing Journey,"Hey y'all. After years worth of anxious deliberation and hesitation, I've decided that if I'm gonna be good at anything I'm just gonna have to start. I've writing some compelling and intriguing D&D campaigns and characters (or so they say lol) but those were mostly improv, and I have won the college poetry contest, so maybe there's some skills here I'm unaware of; I'm not sure

I suppose what I'm asking this: where does one start?? The idea of writing an entire book seems so complex and easy to lose threads and make loopholes. I know that's kinda huge to start with, so I guess that's why I'm here.

Second draft blues,"Hi, just venting because I feel really heartbroke n. I finished writing my first draft a couple of months ago, 105,000 words and I was really proud of myself. As recommended in general, I left it alone for a while, so I could come back with fresh eyes and do the redraft. 

Upon rereading, my immediate reaction was... Burn it with fire! I am exaggerating but only mildly. It feels boring 40% of the time, forced or convoluted 40% and the occasional scene I like. 

I just... thought it made a lot more sense when I was writing it. 

It's kind of disheartening, and I am lost on how to redraft the thing or if it's even worth it. ",8,28,2025-09-22,Minimum_Duty_9362,Advice,0.79
Is the small chance of getting published/making money worth toning down my book?,"So like many people on this sub im writing a fantasy book (inspired by vampire academy, vampire diaries). I like to pretend i'll make it big and envisioned my books on the shelves alongside them. So the tone does read almost like YA, however my protagonist is 21 years old and in her second year of college. It's a college specifically meant for different types of supernaturals with a focus on worshipping goddesses, she's still coming into her powers.

  
There is also a dark romance (enemies to lovers) aspect where the antagonist falls for her but before that he hunts her as revenge to her family, he kills her. He is a very morally grey character. This part comes way later in the book, it starts of just with some normal back to school fluff, meeting new friends etc etc. And a murder mystery.

With the heavy theme, the age and the violence in the book it's comfortably a NA but realistically this genre is niche so it would be adult. 

The problem with this is that Im not planning to write erotica, maybe some spice but nothing similar to what is usually shown in adult fiction. So i wouldnt stand out in the genre that is already less successful. And my book would be in a whole different section than all the books that id like for it to be compared to.

I made the conscious decision because I didnt want to write about teens and especially not with the tension im planning to incorporate. I believe there is already too many fantasy books with underage female protagonists and im tired of picking up fantasy books just for them to be max 17. The youngest id feel comfortable going is 19/18. The story would still work but even then id have to turn down the morally grey themes and violence

I really like my idea and would feel sad if it went completely unnoticed or not even picked up simply because my genre is too niche. I am dutch so the possibillity of getting published is much higher than it would be for Americans. 

So do I give in to the small chance of being published and turn down the intensity of the book or does it not matter and should i just keep going?",3,26,2025-09-22,Ace_One_The,Advice,0.55

I'm studying and learning  about a bunch of topics that will improve my story but i'm not sure how to manage that in a first draft,"So, my story has a lot of philosophical elements I want to add and discuss.

The other protagonist will start out with a sort of empty life, pragmatic in nature, but will also change over time.

It‚Äôs been pretty fun, seeing my characters gain life and complexity before my eyes, feeling alive and real. It actually even helped me come up with the beginning of the story, believe it or not.But i dont wanna fall into the rabit hole of endless planning and forget to actually write, i actually want to have that freedom of the first draft but how do i add these things that will improve as i go, i don't think i wanna rewrite a chapter everytime i discover a more coherent trait for a character or discover a more interesting next step to their arc and such, but i would like to have somethig that feels nicely writen (not perfect) even in this step, how do you deal with that?

Would you read a book about a murderer?,"Hello! I've posted here a few times, but I'm having a bit of trouble with this part of my book. The idea behind the plot so far is that the main character believes he killed his wife, but he didn't. He wallows a lot in the fact and is generally kind of sad, but the purpose of the book is supposed to be a sort of, ""Fix your problems, or they will drown you,"" type of thing. So most of the book is comforting said character for what he feels and he conveniently leaves out the murder part to his friends.   
My problem stems from the fact it is written from his point of view, so there is a lot of back and forth between him feeling like he should move on and feeling like he isnt allowed to because of the terrible thing he did. Is it going to turn people away that I'm trying to garner sympathy for this guy even though he didn't *actually* kill his wife we just don't know that until the end?

Do you think it might be better if we get told he didn't kill her right at the start? My only problem with that is then that it was supposed to be a half hearted plot twist so what then would I replace it with?

Why do some people not believe in artistic merit?,"Sure, people can have different tastes, but inherently, artistic merit is something crystalized, not at all dependent on the personal taste of a selected reader. I'm not talking about whether someone likes or dislikes a work of literature, but when a person altogether dislikes the concept of artistic merit, that arts all have equal artistic merit or artistic value in one way or another.

Personally, I think of arts as a toolbox. There are tools in the toolbox, aka artistic techniques, and different tools serve different functions. However, different tools can also serve the same functions, thus it is up to the user to decide which tool is best fit for a situation.

Artistic merit is when you apply any of those technique to create a final product. A work of literature cannot have artistic merit if it is written like a 5-year-old, or when a technique is mentioned or shown in an example without the final product being a work of literature. Different levels of arts can be reflected in whether the author uses a simple or complex technique for a situation and whether the simple or complex technique is a better fit, or how the author weaves simple and complex techniques together, etc.

This is the area where things could be rather grey, as different author, different reader and different critic could have different understandings of arts. However, a common characteristics of works of arts is that, overtime, their artistic values are increasingly crystalized instead of fading away.

However, there are people who altogether dislike or deny the idea of artistic merit. They think that every work of literature only appeals to different audience, thus every work of literature has equal merit. I find it impossible because every author puts different amounts of effort in the creation of their arts, and applies different techniques in it as well.

When you compare two books written for the same themes, if they were made from different techniques, you cannot say they are equal because there are varying efficiency in regard to each technique. Each author, reader, critic thus have varying perception as to which technique is better, but generally the assumption that ""whichever works fine equally"" is never a good attitude nor a good idea to begin with.

Is it strange to have two versions of the same character?,"Hi! I don't know the right way to explain this without giving too much away... But basically the main theme of my story is time travel, and moving between different timelines where multiple versions of the same characters exist simultaneously. Would it be out of place if for example, version two of a said character killed version one of themselves?

They look the exact same, have (some of) the same memories, and know the same people.

I can't say the reason version two kills version one of themselves, but it's important lol. Essentially version two becomes the main character, despite version one being what the readers sees in book one and half of book 2. So basically version one was the protagonist, and version two was the antagonist. 

I suppose it'd be important to mention my original plan was that the fmc (who was friends with version one) is intended to end up with version two. Which‚Äîis a whole other thing but yeah...

Any criticisms or advice are greatly appreciated, thank you!",0,7,2025-09-22,Old_Necessary9090,Advice,0.27

Children's book writing and the content of that book.,"Hello! I've recently started up writing again, and this time it's books for my kids and the other kids in my family that I hope to publish. 

I'm having a couole of problems, the first one I think is me and I just need to practice, but I tend to describe things too much. It would be a fine description for an adult but kids attention spans at age 7/8 are much shorter.. 


My second issue is my main ask for advice on and it's accidentally sending messages in the books. 

For example 2 children make friends on Holiday with a little girl and while they are playing they find themselves in a magic land and it turns out the girl was a fairy ( I don't want to accidentally send a message to kids that it's ok to wander off with people or leave their parents behind) another example is that a mean cat who wants to rule fairy land eats the crystal they need to return home and turns into a 'monster' cat the children get the crystal back by throwing their favourite blueberry drinks in his mouth and making him sick because he hates blueberries. (This one I don't want kids to hate blueberries or try and feed their cats blueberries) I don't want to change too much of my story as some things like the favourite drink and wanting to be a fairy are pulled from real life inspiration from the children in my family. 

Any advice on whether these things are actually sending a bad message or maybe it's just a can't please everyone situation? ",0,3,2025-09-21,exhaustedOWLs,Advice,0.4

"My first long work may be too long, is this normal?","As the title says, I believe I may have wrote too much for my first actual novel. 

I've always had a habit of ""over-writing,"" but I think I may be putting this one on a bit excessively. 

For the past two years, I've been working on a fictional world that has exceeded the scope of one novel (which is probably also a bad idea for my first work). However, even in one part of that, the first part, I believe the story may be too large to comfortably fit in one novel--however, with how the story is presented, there is no way for me to split this first part. 

I'm less than half, or possibly a third, of the way through actually putting pen to paper and writing down the events of the first book. Despite that, I've somehow managed to accumulate around 80k words, which would probably leave me at around 160k+ during this first draft. 

Unfortunately, I don't even know what I would cut out of this story to make it any shorter. It's very dialogue heavy--but, unfortunately for me, most if not all of the dialogue that I've wrote actually has a purpose, and would be too important for me to shorten.  
  
Is this something normal? Or am I just in over my head writing something beyond my scope that no one would read? Perhaps a lot of this same question has been asked, I apologize for that. But, I really do need to know, is this something that would be easy to cut down on?   
  
It is fantasy, if that helps. I've heard the sweet spot for novels is usually around \~80k, so I'm worried that if I can't cut this down enough, that nobody will read it.   
  
Unfortunately, I have so much to tell, that I already keep my descriptions, dialogue, and everything else short and to the point. Hoping to get any sort of affirmation this isn't an issue, and is pretty common, otherwise I fear a lot of trouble incoming me for the next few months where I have time to actually do this.

Should one write in second language?,"An advice that surely must have been repeated thousand times here for aspiring new writers,""just write"". Yes, I absolutely will just write, but i'm wondering if doing that in my 2nd language (english) is wise?

I love reading, as we all do. But most of my reading material is in english, which i'd guess dominate a lot of what i know about good writing. Not only that, i think i'm stuck between not having great fantasy/fiction/evocative vocabulary in both my native language and also in english. I can't imagine how long would it take for me to reach the level of those native speakers who read books since they were 5 y.o, let alone the level of most famous authors. I think you get the point. Would you say writing skill is dependent on the language used or not? Should i invest time - writing badly, sure - in my native language, or just go straight to english? I personally can enjoy both, but i spent most of my life reading english work, authors like Brandon, Joe Abercrombie, or translated wuxia/xianxia authors,  than anyone in my nat lang.

Imagining a Solarpunk Future Where Africa Becomes Humanity‚Äôs Hub?,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the future and I wanted to share some ideas I‚Äôm exploring for a book I‚Äôm working on.

Picture this: climate change has forced massive migrations, and some parts of the world become almost unlivable. But then‚Ä¶ Africa emerges as the new epicenter of human survival. People from everywhere move there to survive, creating a radically new cultural mix. Traditions blend, languages merge, and a whole new kind of creativity and resilience emerges.

In this world, manual and agricultural work ‚Äî the stuff society tends to ignore today ‚Äî becomes essential for survival. Technology still exists, but it‚Äôs organic, integrated with nature, not something that enslaves humans.

And here‚Äôs the wild contrast: elsewhere, humans become lazy, dependent on machines, sedentary and intellectually dulled‚Ä¶ while in Africa, people reconnect with the earth, with community, with creativity.

Thoughts on How to Structure a Series of Short Stories,"I am currently writing a series of short (20-35 pgs, or about 7,000-13,000 words) superhero sci-fi/mystery stories that are all interconnected. My concept is essentially a comic (in length), but in written story form. So one story leads into the next, but can each be taken as their own separate tale with a beginning, middle, and end. Each one has a set of one to three main characters with an arc that sometimes ends in the current story, or contributes to the overall narrative. 

My plan is to bundle each narrative ""arc"" or volume into a book of about 12-20 stories each, with at least three such volumes roughly sketched out. 

My questions are:

-What would you call this kind of book? I wouldn't describe it as a novel with chapters, as mentioned above, each story is more or less self-contained (aside from some two- or three-part stories). I feel anthology is a bit vague, but it may be what I'm looking for.

-What are your opinions on this form of writing a series? I haven't seen much information of fiction being written like this, but I can be pretty myopic at times.

Many Ideas at once and constantly giving up,"Has this ever happened to you?

Well, I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs common for me that whenever I have an idea, it quickly gets replaced by another one. I remember when I first started writing seriously, I had this science fiction mixed with fantasy idea. In the middle of that story, I started putting too much pressure on myself about how I was writing, and the process stopped being fun. I didn‚Äôt feel connected to my own characters, and then a new idea started to emerge (a urban literature maybe?). I created characters, a whole universe, and sometimes I even got emotional with what I was creating.

Meanwhile, I had another idea, a new sci-fi set in a post-apocalyptic world. I developed it up to a certain point, but didn‚Äôt get too attached, and left it aside while I focused on the other story. Then I had another idea. (Yep, three at the same time)

But... when I started feeling a huge creative block with the urban literature, the idea stopped being exciting for me, and I completely dropped it. I focused on the teen story, which I‚Äôve now abandoned, and at the moment I‚Äôm working on an apocalyptic sci-fi graphic novel, which, to my surprise, has been a different process from the others.

Even though it‚Äôs frustrating to jump from story to story, I feel like I‚Äôve been making progress.

Have you ever experienced this, and what advice would you give to someone going through it?

I am finally going to start writing my first book!,"So, right now I‚Äôm 15 but I will start writing my first book! It will be a sci-fi and police graphic novel for children. I plan to begin the script in what‚Äôs left of 2025 and until 2026, and start drawing the graphic novel either in 2026 (if I finish it before it ends) or 2027, and I will try to finish it in 2028 (there I will be an adult) and try to get my graphic novel published!

And I‚Äôm thinking of naming it: ‚ÄúGood Cop and Bad Cop in Action! (Yes, it will be about Good Cop and Bad Cop, and if the title‚Äôs lame I can change it)

But the story is gonna take place in a fictional city that in some way will be a parody of Gotham City named KrimoTropolis. Still, instead of Batman this city will have a super police force with technologically advanced gadgets (if it helps imagining what I‚Äôm saying know how in spy movies they have cool and technologically advanced gadgets? That‚Äôs what the police here will have). It will be about a young man named Wallace Wellson (the good cop) a wannabe cop in training who just got an Internship in 1 of the city‚Äôs biggest police stations (not because he‚Äôs the best of his class, but because his dad is very influential and got him there). There he meets Jackup Ruby (the bad cop) one of the best cops in KrimoTropolis, working on an investigation of stolen technology and a material called ‚ÄúAur-o-noapte‚Äù, which has proven to attract gold. Wallace decides to get himself involved in the investigation. I‚Äôm not spoiling more of the story and I still have a lot to do but I think you guys already get it!

But this post isn‚Äôt just about talking about the book I will write but about a few questions to become an author

 First of all, even though I live in Portugal I want my book to be published worldwide. And i‚Äôm planning to do so by writing the book in English and try to get a book agent, and if lucky he convences publishers to translate my book from English to there language (and I think this is a good plan because English in kinda the international language and it would be easier for them) the problem when I finish the script I want to have some feedbacks from my family, but accept for me, my brother and my older sister the rest doesn‚Äôt speak English, especially my mom, so what do I do? Do I translate the script to Portuguese or anything?

Also, another question is when I should write the script, should I write on the weekend? (Because that‚Äôs when I have more free time?) Or should I choose specific days or what?

And also where should I write? Right now I only have google docs and my iPad, but my laptop is on repares, the problem is because I don‚Äôt know how to type on a keyboard I‚Äôm super slow but I‚Äôm faster on my tablet, so should I write on my tablet or wait until my laptop even though I‚Äôm super slow (and because everything in my country takes forever to finish it can take a few months to get my laptop back)

Struggling with Very Long Chapters ‚Äì Keep Them or Split Them?,"Hey everyone!

I‚Äôm currently working on my first novel, and I‚Äôve hit my first major snag that‚Äôs left me spinning my wheels for a few weeks now. The book is about a prince named Nevets who has an ability that resets the day whenever he dies (think Edge of Tomorrow but in a fantasy kingdom). I‚Äôve already done a ton of prep work ‚Äî the worldbuilding, character sheets, and a plot outline that covers all 60 chapters, plus a prologue and epilogue.

The structure is pretty tight: the prologue and epilogue are in omniscient POV, but every chapter cycles through four POV characters ‚Äî Nevets, Lyle (a boy outside the kingdom who starts a rebellion), Archie (Nevets‚Äôs best friend and secret magik user ‚Äî yes, spelled with a k), and Claire (Lyle‚Äôs sister). I‚Äôve finished writing about the first third of the book. The first 20 chapters handle the setup, the middle 30 are the bulk of the story, and the final 10 are the setup and execution of the climactic battles.

I know the ‚Äúwrite it all first, edit later‚Äù rule, but I wanted to make sure my writing, scene beats, and continuity were solid before continuing. So, I took what I had written by hand, used a speech-to-text converter to get it typed, cleaned up the errors ‚Äî and that‚Äôs when I hit the problem.

I could finally see the word counts. The prologue is about 3,000 words (cool, no problem). Chapter 1 is about 6,000 (still fine). But then Chapter 2 is roughly 17,000 words and Chapter 3 is about 14,000 words.

Apparently, I didn‚Äôt write chapters ‚Äî I wrote novellas that just happen to have chapter titles slapped on top.

I did some research and found that some epic fantasy books do have really long chapters ‚Äî I read that one of the Wheel of Time books has a chapter around 80,000 words (I‚Äôm in no way comparing myself to Jordan, don‚Äôt worry). But from what I understand, most chapters should be closer to 5‚Äì6,000 words.

Here‚Äôs the dilemma: if I cut anything from these long chapters, it would mean removing pivotal scenes that carry the plot forward. But if I split the chapters, I‚Äôd have to find a way to keep the four-POV cycle balanced, which means adding new chapters for the other characters, potentially creating scenes that don‚Äôt actually need to exist just to maintain rhythm.

Has anyone else faced this problem? Should I leave the chapters as they are since they work narratively, or should I find a way to split them (even if it means some artificial breaks or filler chapters)?

Any advice would be appreciated!",0,5,2025-09-20,deleted,N/A,0.33

My first book/trilogy would you read? Dark Romance,"So.

I started writing a story that slowly grew in my heart and on the page. Now it‚Äôs turning into a trilogy.

I‚Äôve already written about 70% of the first book, 50% of the second, and around 10% of the third. I actually enjoy writing them all at once, because it‚Äôs comforting for me to jump back and forth in the timeline. Changing something in the first book that affects the last one, or adding something to the last book and weaving it back into the first. It‚Äôs almost like time travel in my writing. And I‚Äôm quite proud of how things are coming along.

**But here‚Äôs the part where I really want opinions.**

My book is a dark romance, at least by theme, though I‚Äôm not entirely sure how to classify it. When people think of dark romance, they often imagine something erotic or focused on physical intimacy. Mine isn‚Äôt exactly like that. 

I know it‚Äôs not for every reader, and I know the theme is both niche and problematic. That always makes me hesitate about whether I should publish it someday or keep it to myself.

Basically,  
My books explore a relationship between two siblings. Yes, an incestuous romance. But my story follows their lives from childhood into adulthood. I want to show the full development: how these feelings were born, how they deal with them, and the consequences they bring.

My goal is to create a kind of modern-day Romeo and Juliet, with a realistic focus on the consequences and the impact this relationship has on their lives. The first book would cover their childhood/youth,  
the second their late teens/young adulthood,  
and the third their adult lives.

Most books I‚Äôve seen on this theme treat it as a fetish or simply throw it in without development. I want to explore and develop this forbidden romance fully, showing its emotional depth and its repercussions.

**So my question is:** 

Would you read something like this?  
Do you think it‚Äôs something publishable, or should I keep it to myself?

Again, I know it‚Äôs a problematic theme, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking for honest opinions.

How walking can help boost your creativity,"Since 2018, I have written well over 200,000 words.

I have used my brain to write material for previous failed blogs, stories I started but have not finished, Facebook posts that I hope are inspirational and as a guest writer for online publications.

Yet still, I don‚Äôt believe in writer‚Äôs block.

(Insert \*gasp\* here‚Ä¶)

When I say I don‚Äôt believe in writer‚Äôs block, I mean I don‚Äôt believe in stopping to write just because you hit a wall. I believe you can break through, or walk around, or leap over the wall if you really wanted to finish the work at hand. You just have to be dedicated to learning how to do that.

(btw, I'm not knocking the need to rest, I'm knocking abruptly quitting on a writing project)

Getting over, around or through tough times of creativity can be a creative task in and of itself. What works for me may not work for you, but walking is a common action most can take to get their creative juices going again.

Here‚Äôs 6 (of many) ways walking boosts your creativity:

1. **Walking enhances divergent thinking.**¬†Divergent thinking is the process of coming up with multiple solutions for a problem at the same time. That means, you can activate parts of your brain that use critical thinking for creative solutions.
2. **Walking Improves your mood**. As fun as working on a craft can be, the activity can get stressful. This certainly goes for perfectionists. Walking often releases endorphins reduces anxiety and stress. Yes, even short walks will do that for ya!

1. **Walking enhances clarity and focus**. Movement gets the blood going. Your block may be in the form of anxiety. Walking clears mental fog so you can think clearly and deal with less anxiety.
2. **Walking stimulates what is known as the default mode network**. The network consists of brain centers we use to daydream, reminisce and plan with. Thus, walking gives you access to more mental resources.
3. **Walking breaks habitual thought loops**. I have been stuck with mundane, non-creative thoughts about my work that made me become more agonized by the minute. Walking has helped me break through. It does so by activating various brain centers that invite new thoughts.
4. **Walking enriches creative output by engaging multiple senses**. In other words, walking taps into other body functions while connecting ideas that don‚Äôt seem to relate to each other. For instance, if you are writing a story and want a character to finally fall in love with someone else",0,3,2025-09-20,trublaze87,Advice,0.27
I need some advice about a character‚Äôs d*ath in my manuscript,"TW: blood, graphic d*ath scene





Okay, so I just finished writing my very first book ever (woohoo!)

I finished the first draft of the manuscript a few weeks ago and just finished the first round of editing this morning. 

Towards the end of the book my MC‚Äôs best friend dies by getting shot in the neck and bleeding to death in an elevator. 

With the events that have transpired recently this left a bad taste in my mouth as I was editing it. 

I wrote this before said events transpired, but now I‚Äôm thinking I should change it? I need the character to die in a very violent way that is not instant and leaves the friend unable to speak because the MC witnesses her friend‚Äôs passing and it changes the entire course of her actions. 

Any advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated. Also, just to clarify, I‚Äôm not asking how to change it. I can try and figure that out myself. I‚Äôm mostly just trying to gauge if it‚Äôs appropriate to leave the scene as it is, or if you as writers would change it. (I hope/think this is allowed per the rules)

Also, please don‚Äôt give your two cents on the real world events that have happened in the last week or so. I know people have different perspectives on it and I‚Äôm just trying to keep this thread respectful. ",0,12,2025-09-21,Aloofbee,Advice,0.11

"Writing Your Story Vs Writing about your story, and why you should do both","Forward momentum is incredibly important to me. I believe that only after completing your fastest lap can you achieve an even faster one that follows. It‚Äôs very important to stay as consistent as you can but writers block is real.

On the days you can‚Äôt think of material for your narrative, still write /about/ your story. What I mean is let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre writing a book. You‚Äôre at chapter 7 or so, but can‚Äôt really figure out what else to put. In these moments, I either lack knowledge of my world, or my characters. Because story‚Äôs are pushed by plots, plots are pushed by people, and people are pushed by the story. Go back and figure out what‚Äôs stalled. 

If the plot is unreachable, it means the people are not well flushed out, which means at some point you missed an interaction or an opportunity for one, earlier on in the story. So your story isn‚Äôt pushing people towards the plot. 
I recommend pausing from writing the story, and instead write about the story, which is documenting all known knowns and known unknowns, sequentially. 


1. Write personal wiki articles for every character that starts from their birth and goes through their death, even if the death is after the book. 

2. Write the sequences of your plots in chronological order, excluding specifics. It should be something like ‚Äúcause, effect, reaction, fallout, effect, response, effect, reaction, conclusion‚Äù. This depends on how many acts you have. (My example would be like a 9 act book) 

3. Write a quick rundown of all your chapters, in order, as if you were telling a friend about the event over the phone. Just give the key points. 

When these are done, you have a clear idea of how your mechanics are supposed to flow, and subsequently you can match all sections together. Your story will push your people towards moving the plot, which will then move your story. ",6,6,2025-09-20,KnottyDuck,Discussion,0.71
Looking for advice regarding publishing first book.,"Hi. I'm a bit stuck. I've got a book that is pretty much at first draft stage but complete, which is a book that is sort of philosophical in nature.

I have another book rattling around in my head that I'd like to start, a sci/fantasy sort of caper - but I find myself a bit crippled.

What do I do at this stage? I'm probably a bit autistic and just have no idea what to do now. I feel like I could keep writing eternally and will just end up with a bunch of documents that will get lost to time - writing isn't the problem. It's getting it published. I lack the confidence or knowledge to take it further.

Do I take the draft and just start firing it off at publishers? What is the process there and how to best approach it? I thought about Amazon or whatever but for the philosophy book in particular that's probably not possible as it directly contradicts the philosophy of the book in a way.

Long winded already but any advice on this stage would be appreciated.",0,4,2025-09-20,BaronGreywatch,N/A,0.5

Writing or not writing a memoir if you have to use your real name?,"Hi, so my story is complicated and not sure if it goes here. Some years ago (3) and the years before I wanted to write a memoir about my life. Especially about the last period of it. But/and, it would talk quite bad about my parents. The point is that when I wanted to write it I wanted to escape home, and thought it would be fine to talk bad about them (they are partially narcissistic, did verbal violence, my mother gaslighting etc and father threatened to hit me etc) since I need to talk about when I escaped from home. The problem is now I live with them and I care less about what they say and we rekindled a bit since I care less about what they say and getting money from father means that if I talked bad about them they may lose points so to say socially and may even get less customers! And then they would be furious at me. I also wouldn't like to destroy their life so much. They will retire soon, 3/4 years...but still, if I live here it's more difficult to write it. I thought, even if I get a contract, it could even be for a few money and even supposed it is like 100000 then anyway I wouldn't have enough to survive only with one book. Plus, I should probably be home while writing and at least a bit after.

I have since gotten a better idea that unfortunately requires a massive rewrite.

Now I have 4 main povs. So essentially povs 1 and 2 are timeline A,  then povs 3 and 4 take right after. But it's going to be presenting at the same time in the book. 
The idea is the reader will be able to put the peices together at the end of part 2.

So my question is how can I make this work better? Does anyone have any experience weaving multiple povs with different timelines together?

Edit

Ran out of time during my lunch. So to further explain

Pov 1 and 2 run concurrently (week 1 to 6)
Pov 3 and 4 run concurrently (week 6 to 9) 

Now the real trick is pov 1 and pov 3 are the same character just with a mental split so they act differently.  Only small hints will be dropped during the pov to link them together. Things in hindsight will make more sense

Then part 3 everything syncs up for the finale. 

Thats my real crutch. But this idea is like blowing up my mind.

Vietnamese author found out about 20.000 illegal copies of his book,"Author Ho√†ng Nam Ti·∫øn, the Vice president of the FPS University Council, allegedly discovered about 20.000 illegal copies of his book ""Th∆∞ Cho Em."" As of now, the official sales of the book have reached 45.000. Basically, almost half of the potential income from the book has been stolen by pirates.

He said in a recent conference:

>""I realized an anomaly, I tried to look up the online book stores and social medias and, through them, discovered fake books, illegal books, which are rightfully mine, getting sold publicly and widely. Not only a few hundred or a few thousand, but tens of thousands of copies.""

The author shared stories about young authors coming to his publishing service, Alpha Book, to claim ""rewards"" in an online writing competition allegedly organized by his company, only to find out that competition was a scam by pirate bookstores, and now their works were practically stolen by pirates as well.

He said:

>""They took our actual image, created a whole ecosystem of scamming from books, websites, to gifting programs.""

In response to the author's comment, Mrs. Ph·∫°m Th·ªã Kim Oanh, an important officer in the publishing industry and legal protection for authors against piracy, said:

>""I see here that it seems like there is a lack of proactivity from the owners of intellectual properties, even by publishing services, units of publishing, since the law has already had rules, but only complaining is not enough.""

She continued to mention laws against piracy. However, she further commented:

>""I believe that the problem is not the lack of laws, but whether or not the owners of intellectual properties are ready to see the end of it or not. From the collecting of evidence, suing, collaborating with publishing services, all require determination and investment.""

>""Criminals are very good at technology, they are anonymous, they offshore their servers, making it difficult for investigating agencies.""

The circle I thought of (of course it's a work in progress, nothing final):

1 A character (who has a character flaw) is in a zone of comfort

2 But wants something (which he/she wants due to his/her character flaw)

3 Goes to a new situation/place

4 Adapts to it

5 Finds what he/she wanted (fills the want)

6 He/She is in a zone of discomfort

7 Realizes what he/she needs

8 Goes to a new situation to find it

9 Adapts to the new situation

Writing non-linearly when you get stuck,"I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts on here about perfectionism and writers block and wanted to share a mindset I‚Äôve recently adapted that has helped me improve my creative process IMMENSELY.

I once was a stickler for perfection, was scared of the revision process, and only ever wrote my novels chapter by chapter in order. I would constantly get writers block, have no motivation to write, and most of the time ended up with a shitty final draft because the middle of my story had no idea where the end was going to end up.

My most recent project started out as something ‚Äúfun.‚Äù I would come up with a scene in my head and write it, and when I finally got serious into turning it into a real project, I had so many chapters already written to build the story around. Since starting this project, here are a few practices I‚Äôve put into place:

- write every day. Set a doable word/page goal. Mine is 500 words a day and most of the time I end up writing more than that, even if it‚Äôs writing I end up cutting from the story a month later

- don‚Äôt start at the beginning. Start in the middle, at the end, start with a scene that won‚Äôt even be in the book. It helps you get so much closer to your story and helps you understand the scenes you will include.

- write in character POVs that aren‚Äôt in the book. This kind of goes along with my last point, but recently I‚Äôve struggled with understanding the villain of my story so I said F it, today my 500 words are going to be in his perspective about this event that happens. The way i started writing things that fit with the story so well that I didn‚Äôt even think of! They were just waiting to come out and they weren‚Äôt going to work in the POV of my protagonist

- if you love a scene, write it, but don‚Äôt publish it. I‚Äôve had so many chapters I want to fit into my story, I love them and they are great by themselves but they don‚Äôt fit in the story. I write them anyway and keep them in a spare doc just for me. Once again, helps you understand your story

- reread your story when you need inspiration. I can‚Äôt even count the amount of times I go back and read something I wrote months before and think to myself ‚Äúdamn this is good!‚Äù Or leave notes in the margins like ‚ÄúI changed my mind about this.‚Äù Don‚Äôt treat it as a revision, don‚Äôt put any expectations on it, just read what you wrote as if you‚Äôve never encountered it before. I will read some scenes over and over again and it will make me hunger for more of my own scenes to write so all I can do is sit down and write them for future me

"Objectively ""good"" or ""bad"" prose doesn't exist","Beyond the fact that ""good"" and ""bad"" are inherently relative, everyone's tastes are different. This is probably going to turn into a bit of a rant, but I hate condescending know-it-alls who recommend books based solely on how purple the prose is. 

I believe that language should be a tool ; one you can use to elicit emotions, but simple overuse of metaphors and a thesaurus isn't a good thing. Others like flowery, purplish prose and I can only say: good for you ! And a thousand other variations. 

Some prose can be jarring and pull you out of the story. That's okay ; you don't like that type of prose. Good for you. But to blindly refer to certains books as possessing a special, laudable sort of prose is stupid. 

It's well-known that you will write what you have recently read, and that includes prose. Therefore you must regularly ""infuse"" yourself with the kind of prose you want to write. But there is no prose you *have* to use, or have to avoid at all costs. It's all about taste, and that's possibly *the* most personal, subjective thing in the world.

Part Two of Testing Writing Routines (So You Don‚Äôt Have To),"In this second part, I tried the following experiment: writing 2,500 words in a single day and then taking two days off. 

It was kind of like a writing intensive, writing a lot on one day and then taking some breaks so I wouldn‚Äôt burn out.

Alongside that, I kept the rule of consuming at least three hours per week of content related to my current project, whether it was movies, series or books.

I followed this routine for two weeks and here is how it went.
Right away, I realized that writing so much in one go was really exhausting. It took me about two hours to hit the 2,500-word mark and, with work and life happening around me, it was hard to stay focused. So I came up with the idea of breaking the word count into several mini writing sessions throughout the day until I reached the goal. That worked a lot better.

With that change, I managed to stick to the routine of writing one day and resting the next two for the entire two weeks. And the result was really good.
In the previous routine I tested, which was writing every day except Saturdays and Sundays, with a goal of 500 words per day, I had written 10,000 words in two weeks.
Now, with this new routine, I reached 26,000 words in two weeks; in other words, 16,000 more words than the other method. And the best part is that I felt much happier and more productive, with time to breathe and keep my mind in a good place.",61,12,2025-09-16,Super_Background_293,Discussion,0.97

Detailed descriptions - general thoughts,"I am reading ""No Country for Old Men"" for the first time. I've read ""Blood Meridian"" about a decade ago. 

Going through the book I'm struck by how McCarthy describes scenes. For example, he details how Moss goes to a store to purchase tents to get the support sticks out of them. The entire thing is presented on the page including Moss talking to a clerk and then buying several tents. McCarthy only shows the use of the later. But McCarthy could have simply written something like ""Moss went to the store and pursed a set of tents for their support poles.""

Do you ever give your antagonist equal stage time? What does that unlock or risk?,"I‚Äôm working on a lengthy science fiction story, and after all the work of creating what I think are deep characters,  am giving the antagonist nearly equal narrative weight to the protagonist(s), even early in the story.

It wasn't planned at all. I dislike mindless villains and their hordes so possibly it was a natural evolution of that thinking.

This character isn‚Äôt evil for evil‚Äôs sake. He‚Äôs intelligent, complex, shaped by trauma, and driven by a belief system that makes complete sense to him, even if it‚Äôs deeply unsettling to others (and he will be unsettling.) Some scenes from his point of view feel like they belong to a completely different book... until they begin to weave back into the main story arc.



What I‚Äôm wanting to be wary of is:

Does giving the antagonist equal time deepen the story, or dilute the focus?

Has anyone tried something similar and run into pacing or empathy issues?

What keeps a complex villain from taking over the reader‚Äôs emotional attention too early?

I got better at it as time went on, but I just had this niggling feeling that I‚Äôd write better in first. But I was so deep in the story, I felt like I should just persist. Nope, the feeling continued to grow, so I decided to go back and write my first chapter in first person - I‚Äôd wanted to completely change it anyway, and the difference is like night and day. It‚Äôs so much easier to write. I can type away a 1000 words like nothing, where I‚Äôd stop and stew over how to word things in third. The pacing is much easier, and the words just fly off my fingertips. I wish I‚Äôd started earlier. So trust me, take the advice from others - write a chapter in both and figure out what works for you! From 25k words to 2.5k üòÖ I‚Äôm now back at the start, but I know it‚Äôll take me half the time to get to 25k at least. Despite the time delay, I‚Äôm actually really excited about my book now.

1st Person POV  vs  4th Wall?,"In a recent discussion, I discovered I could not describe the difference between first person point of view and an actual fourth wall break.  Doing some research, I came across:

"Something I wish I learned years ago: your ""fantastic idea for a book"" should not be your first book","If there is one thing I wish I realized years ago, it's that walking around with that Big Book Idea in your head will block you and keep you from getting anything on the page. I found there are several reasons for this:



1)You will fear you won't do it justice and that will keep you from trying.

This one is obvious.

2) It is often a crutch to keep thinking you are a writer even if you haven't written anything. You will think of the Big Book Idea and think 'this means I am a writer'.

Again, fairly obvious

3) It's not sustainable to have this one Big Book Idea and think that's a career.

You don't want to just produce that One Big Book. You want books, plural. That means having more than one idea.

Because of all that, I found it necessary to start working on 'an idea' rather than 'That Big Idea'. To not go for literary genius but for something fun.

Basically, lower my own expectations a lot and feel free to tackle an idea and turn it into a book, rather than produce The Big Book.

I don't know if anyone finds this at all helpful but it was an eye opener for myself. Giving myself permission to 'just produce a book that's fun' rather than trying to keep myself to impossible and crippling standards.",0,9,2025-09-16,TheBl4ckFox,Discussion,0.33

Should I stick to what I'm good at or keep trying to write fiction?,"I feel that I am naturally pretty good at conveying my thoughts with the written word. Good at persuasive writing, essays, opinion pieces, content writing, branding & marketing. Things like that. I want to write memoir and fiction but I am finding it quite challenging, particularly fiction. 

I have amped up my reading as I know that will be a huge help. I've read around 40 books this year so far. I am also trying to force myself to freewrite regularly. I do find myself becoming discouraged because it feels like all I'm good at is expressing my thoughts or analyzing things if that makes sense. My freewriting often feels like journaling. It turns into navel-gazing and speculation.

Does anyone have any thoughts or recommendations on this? I guess I naively thought I'd be good at fiction and the like since other types of writing come so easily to me. Any specific exercises I should focus on in addition to my freewriting practice? I know everyone just says to write and I'm not sure if this is an ADHD thing or a trauma thing or what but I become very overwhelmed when I have no constraints. My brain goes in a million different directions.

How do I stop feeling insecure about my writing?,"I‚Äôm a novice writer and I‚Äôm trying to complete my very first novel. The problem is I‚Äôm severely insecure over my writing, to the point where it‚Äôs hindering my process. I keep rewriting scenes and leaving a bunch of comments for myself on what to fix, so I haven‚Äôt made much progress. My friends and family have been super supportive, they‚Äôve been encouraging me and praising me for being a good writer. A few even offered to be beta readers for me. They firmly believe I will be published and tell me so. 

The truth is, I don‚Äôt think this book will get published. I don‚Äôt think my writing is good enough, and I don‚Äôt think the story I‚Äôm writing will be popular. I‚Äôm writing this book more for myself and have pretty low hopes of being successful, but it‚Äôs still weirdly making me feel bad enough to not want to continue writing? I think it‚Äôs because everyone around me has so much faith in my writing but I don‚Äôt. I really wish I could be delusional enough to feel proud of my work. I used to post on Wattpad when I was much younger and it got pretty popular, but I hated my writing so much I ended up deleting the entire account.

Trying to enjoy reading again,"I've been working on a first draft for a novel after a long period of not being able to write. Now that I'm deep into getting it done I've been struggling with reading for fun. I've always been an avid reader though I would have dry spells due to life getting in the way. I'm trying to read more with the eye of a writer, especially in my genre, but it's hard to really enjoy it or immerse myself in the books I read. 

A big part of it is that reading published works makes me insecure about the quality of my own prose and story telling. I know that logically I cannot be comparing my first draft to someone's published works but it triggers anxious thoughts about how I can never reach that level of writing. 

Another part is that I used to be a stronger writer when I was younger but being out of practice for several years has made my skills more rusty and that has been discouraging.

I love writing but I feel like it's killed the fun of reading for me. Idk if anyone else is going through the same. Or if they have gone through the same what has helped them. 

I'm planning to take a break after I finish my first draft but probably work on another project because I really do enjoy writing when I'm engaging in it. Its mainly when I'm not actively writing that the anxiety and insecurity comes in. ",3,8,2025-09-15,mistyvalleyflower,Discussion,0.64

A Question for my book (I don‚Äôt want to accidentally sound blasphemous),"Hey Reddit!

I‚Äôm an autistic student working on a book for a passion project. I‚Äôve been thinking about publishing it in the future too, but I want to make sure I don‚Äôt accidentally say anything bad as an author. Thus, I was wondering what the internet thinks of my book title, and if I could do anything to improve it so I don‚Äôt accidentally be blasphemous.

The themes for the book I believe (I haven‚Äôt checked if these fit) are; Science fiction, a bit of romance, probably fantasy too lol, superheros(???) and I‚Äôm unsure if I should add ‚Äúreligion‚Äù or something like it‚Ä¶ The title I have for my book is ‚ÄúThe Boy Who Became God‚Äù, due to it being about a boy who gains superpowers from scientists (Like how Mutants have their powers in MARVELs universe) which are ‚Äògodlike‚Äô

For a bit more context; the MC (main character) can will anything they want to happen when they want it to happen, how they want it to happen). I make a point at the start of my prologue that the book has no association(connotation ?) to specific religions, though in my book there is the name ‚ÄòSera‚Äô (as in seraphim) and the fact MC is referred to as a god in a general sense, throughout my book (purely just because of their power level)

My thought process with the ‚Äòpower level‚Äô thing is the possibly clich√© ‚Äúaverage, above average, skilled, highly skilled, pro, master, god‚Äù tiering thing lol

The reason for this post is; I had a conversation with someone who was having issues with the title of my book and how I referred to the MC as a god. (Again in a general sense, I don‚Äôt mean ‚Äògod‚Äô as in a specific religions), and they were under the impression I was being blasphemous and making a mockery of their religion.
Truthfully; I think it was fair for them to be upset at those things since they‚Äôve said that so many other books, shows and movies play on their religion.

TLDR; My book is called ‚ÄúThe Boy Who Became God‚Äù though I mean it in a general term due to the Main Characters superpower level. I don‚Äôt want to accidentally sound blasphemous. What can I do to make sure I don‚Äôt upset people with this?",0,8,2025-09-15,TeddyG0ld,Advice,0.33

Writing for the first time: the edit is where your writing will live,"Your first draft of your first book will most likely be trash.  Unless your a once-in-a-generation author that puts pen to paper and churns out a perfect first draft.  There is so much angst over what should or shouldn't happen on this sub.  You can read ""On Writing"" or ""Save the Cat!"" or ""Story Genius"" and follow it to a T.  The first draft of the first novel will not be worth the paper you are printing it on.  

That said, please keep writing.  Write the first draft and edit the holy crap out of it.  Then edit it again.  Write a second novel and edit it.  I promise you, you'll learn more about writing in the rewrite/edit phase than you ever will while putting words down in the first draft.  

Learn if you're a plotter/pantser; gardener/architect; outliner/free-writer.  Try writing with an outline and then just where you're fingers take you and see which one works better for you.  

Just keep in mind, even if you have  a super-dooper outline planned, you will almost certainly come up with new ideas and, hopefully, integrations of secondary ideas that will ruin your outline.  If it does, fix your outline and then keep writing. 

Don't worry about your voice, characterizations, style or anything else until you have a full first draft completed.  Again, the rewrite is king.  You'll add thousands of more words to flesh out descriptions, characters, and motivations in the edit.  

I say this because I see dozens of posts every day asking about how to do this or that while the author is still working on the first draft of their story.  Get your draft finished first, then worry about crafting the perfect narrative.

"Correct use of em dash to offset dialogue? ""Line""--afterthought.","Here's the line in question. Also note, my Word connects the two dashes into an emdash, but I can't replicate it here.

>‚ÄúThe cancer is back‚Äù-‚Äìfour words, dropped like the punchline to a cosmic joke.

I want the ""four words"" part to feel like an afterthought to the recalled line of dialogue. But this looks like a grammar mistake. Alternatively, I could do:

>""The cancer is back."" Four words, dropped like the punchline to a cosmic joke.

I  don't want to do anything like:

>""The cancer is back,"" she said. Four words...

Because this is from the very opening of the book, I'm trying to keep things a little more surrealish before we dive into the actual scene. 

This is the full opening, for context. 

>I found out I was dying on the first morning of April.

>‚ÄúThe cancer is back‚Äù‚Äì‚Äìfour words, dropped like the punchline to a cosmic joke.

>My first thought: *April Fools?*

If you all can think of a better way to make this land, I'd be eternally grateful. I've been tinkering with this opening so many times! Please share your thoughts so I know if I'm on the right track, or if I might need to go an entirely different direction. The original opening is below, but it felt a little clunkier, like I'm misusing the metaphor. Stories don't END at the third-act plot twist either, you know?

>My story began where most would end, with an epic third-act plot twist, delivered on the first morning of April, no less:

How I finally got Goodreads to believe that I wrote my own book.,"I self-published my first book about 3 weeks ago on Amazon KDP.  It was a passion project, as I couldn't imagine many people wanting to read a dark comedy about psychedelics, liminal experiences, and mostly failed efforts to find a higher spiritual meaning in our transactional world.  The only promotion I had intended to do was to get a Goodreads author account.  However, getting a Goodreads account was much more cumbersome than I had intended.

The first obstacle was that Goodreads required that I have an author website.  I hadn't particularly wanted such a website--that's what I had intended my Goodreads page to be.  But if it had to be done, I decided I might as well do it the way I want to.  I got my own domain, and I hastily coded an HTML page that had the minimum Goodreads requirements.

I was surprised when they rejected me.  My website address was (my name dot com) and my email address was (my name at my name dot com).  Why would Goodreads think that an impostor would take the trouble to make a domain to take credit for an unknown independent release.  According to my latest sales report, my mother lied to me about purchasing a copy.  (I must remember this come Mother's Day.)

I contacted support, and they sent a prompt reply.  Reading the reply, I could tell that the service rep had actually taken the trouble to look at my dumb little web page.  Why couldn't he see that I was indeed the author and approve me right there?  In any case, the advice was not helpful.

Back to the drawing board.  I went back and made substantial improvements to my site, adding a header graphic, a portrait, and a bio.  Then I even started writing a commentary and easter egg guide for my book.  (Just for fun.)

Having done all this, I applied again to Goodreads, and...rejected.  At this point, it was so hilariously dystopian, that I forgot about my frustration.

I made yet another effort.  I updated my Goodreads profile, added my website to the profile, and I wrote a little about my book in the author bio section.  Then I made another pass at improving my website.  I added a touch of Javascript to make the text sections collapsible, and I added in media queries to make sure that it came up looking good on my phone, my tablet, and on my my big screen desktop.

As a final touch, I added a line of Javascript so that when the page loads, a pop-up text box comes up to say ""Maybe one day Goodreads will believe that I wrote my own book.  One can only dream.""

I applied again, and APPROVED!

It can be done!

Posting your chapters on Substack/Blog/Other?,"Hi all, back again with more questions lol!

I am about 30K words into the first draft of my first book. I was thinking of at some point launching a Substack where I can start introducing my cast of characters to the world. The idea was to post chapters, quotes, characters, IDK stuff like that and hopefully ramp up some interest. 

**The questions I have for those in this wonderful group whom have done something similar:** 

* Do I wait until I have a more polished 2nd or 3rd draft before posting anything, knowing that the first draft is usually ‚Ä¶ a first draft. Or is it OK to post what I have now and let people know that things might and will change as the evolution of the book develops.

Youtube ‚Äòauthors‚Äô and ‚Äòwriters‚Äô are destroying aspiring authors.,"I don‚Äôt want to mention any names because I don‚Äôt want to sound like a bitter hater, but there are SO many youtubers and influencers whose entire career depends on ‚Äòteaching‚Äô aspiring authors how to write, how to become writers etc, and A LOT of aspiring authors depend so much on the advice of these people.

These are people who have not written a book in their lives, and if they have, the books are absolutely shockingly bad. There is one particular YouTuber who gives advice on how to write fantasy characters and how to world build etc, and his videos are incredibly well made, he wrote a fantasy book and it was about the most generic thing i‚Äôve read, he didn‚Äôt even follow his own advice.

But the craziest thing? They have the absolute AUDACITY to sell courses and workshops for hundreds of dollars on how to write, how to write a book etc.

Their entire business model is not to actually write, but make you believe that they CAN. 

I watch a lot of movies, I wouldn‚Äôt know shit about making movies. 

I‚Äôd love to hear what others think.",6461,880,2025-09-11,bytolgakoz,Discussion,0.94
Would Lovecraft be accepted by am editor these days,"I've read a few books and heard some podcasts on fiction writing. Practically all of them said: avoid adverbs of mode and adjectives of quality.

Instead, they advise in looking for more precise nouns and verbs or just using more sentences to describe that noun instead. Yet, most of my favorite writers like Edgar Alan Poe and H. P. Lovecraft use tons of such words. I've seen Lovecraft use three adjectives and an adverb to describe a diary.

Is that just a product of their times? Something particular of the horror genre? Are those advices just nonsense?

Writing a book was never my goal...,"Am I alone? One day I was trying to figure out what to write in my journal and ended up writing a short portion of a story. I shared it with a coworker who then asked when I was going to finish it. He was genuinely interested in reading it. I never meant to start writing. Now I have multiple stories partially written. I don't care if I ever publish, but I do want to finish that first one so I don't disappoint my coworker, lol. I just wondered if anyone else didn't mean to start writing.

Filter Words Are Okay. (sometimes),"This post is born out of frustration because I just spent 2 hours doing final line edits on my manuscript. I did a word search for ""eyes"" and found that I used it 351 times in 390 pages. While that's admittedly too many, the process of trying to replace a lot of these instances has been making me absolutely insane.

Every ""writing advice"" blog or video screams about filter words like they're toxic waste. ""Never use looked! Never use saw! Show don't tell!"" And in the process of trying to follow this advice, I've written some truly awful prose. Instead of just using ""she looked at him,"" I'm writing garbage like ""her gaze traveled to the sharp contours of his face.""

The whole ""show don't tell"" and ""eliminate filter words"" movement started as helpful advice for beginner writers who were drowning their prose in unnecessary filters like ""I felt that I thought that maybe I saw..."" But somewhere along the way it's morphed into this rigid dogma that treats perfectly normal, functional words like they're poison.

I don't think I've ever put a book down because the author used filter words. I read a ton of King and he uses ""looked"" constantly. And it works just fine.

The best authors use these words a lot because they just work and get out of the way. They're invisible to readers who are absorbed in the story. ""She looked at him"" is clear and direct. ""Her azure orbs locked his gaze"" is the kind of overwrought nonsense that actually makes me cringe.

It's like that bell curve meme where the newbie writes ""she looked at him,"" the ""expert"" writes some purple monstrosity to avoid filter words, and the master goes right back to ""she looked at him.""

Characters have to look at things. It's literally how humans interact with the world. We have like 6 words in English for ""looking at something"" and fiction writers need them hundreds of times per book. 

My new rule is: If my story flows and readers are engaged, I'm doing it right. Stop torturing yourself over arbitrary rules made up by people who probably haven't read widely enough to notice that published authors break these kinds of ""rules"" constantly.

That's all, thanks for reading.",324,64,2025-09-12,MrSloppyPants,Advice,0.93
Writing with ADD/ADHD,"Genuinely one of the most vile disorders a writer could have. I cannot for the life of me finish a book or even outline one because I get bored or distracted so easily.

Advice for book pacing (specifically ‚Äòfluff‚Äô),"I am an aspiring author, and I have a few different books I‚Äôve been working on. A common issue I find in most of my writing is pacing. I often find myself wanting to rush into the action, climax, or important moments of the book, rather than taking the time to build the characters and brief interactions.
I feel like I‚Äôm bad at writing these small moments that seem unimportant (but ultimately are important for character development, relationship context, etc.). Especially when it comes to introductions and small talk. I am introverted and I HATE small talk in general, so I especially hate writing it. 
Does anyone have any advice for this? ",4,28,2025-09-13,Linquinidragon,N/A,0.75
Epilogue or final chapter?,"I am rounding the bend on completely completing my first stand alone novel. It is a historical fiction that spans continents but the timeline only lasts about a year and a half. I  have been struggling with whether my last (I'll say chapter) should be labeled as a final chapter or an epilogue. I've answered the obvious questions for myself. The chapter before could stand alone, and does, but I'm the type of person who hates a book ending with questions. Without the chapter/epilogue in question, the novel would certainly leave readers with some ""but what happened with..."" Over all, the ""chapter"" is about 1/3 as long as all the others and much more straight to the point. It wraps up most of the unanswered questions and takes place around six months after the previous chapter. So, what do you think? Epilogue or smaller, final chapter?

Fanfic?,"Anyone else use fanfic to help them out? (Delete if not allowed on here)

But hear me out, okay??

I have been an avid fanfic writer for a couple years now and I've written loads of different stuff. Pirate AUs, wild west AUs, 1800 London AUs, etc. And I noticed whenever I sit down to write, I am always so much more excited and interested in writing my dumb little fanfics than I am when actually writing rhe book I had planned out. 

Does anyone else do this? Do other fanfic writers (if here) have more interest in writing their ff more than their actual novels?

I decide recently that a Pirate AU I'm working heavily on would make for a fantastic fantasy read if I tweaked the details and used OCs to turn it into something worth publishing, and I noticed I'm beginning to do this with a lot of my other books. 

Currently writing two stand alone novels (rom and fantasy) that I cannot find the inspo to work on and finish, but changing it into a fanfic has me made that much more excited to write it, and I'l switch it back to OCs 

Am I the only one?

I've given up on writers groups. A rant.,"I‚Äôve tried. Really, I have. But every time I join a writers group, I run into some mix of the same four people.

There's the edgy anime bro: mid-twenties, hoodie with something like *Death Note* or *Invader Zim* on it, and a writing style that's essentially fanfic plus thinly veiled trauma dump. Their only exposure to fiction is anime, manga, and wattpad erotica.

Then there's the divorced romance enthusiast, mid-forties, writing what is clearly softcore porn with characters who look suspiciously like her ex-husband, her coworker, or a barista she once exchanged eye contact with. Always with a healthy dose of ""The Writer's Barely-Disguised Fetish""

Next is the worldbuilder. He‚Äôs got 1,200 years of history mapped out, a binder full of languages, and a hexagonal map of his fantasy continent, but not a single completed short story. He‚Äôs building a universe with no people in it.

And finally, the eternal workshopper. Usually an English lit teacher or MFA graduate who's been polishing Chapter One of their magnum opus since 2006. If you ask them about querying they suddenly look like a deer in the headlights.

Those quirks should be fine. Mostly they don't bother me (that much). I just see the same archetypes so often that it almost seems to be parody.

But the real reason I‚Äôve given up on writers groups?

The crab bucket.

You know what the metaphor is: crabs in a bucket will pull each other down rather than let one escape. That‚Äôs what these groups become. The second someone shows real progress (getting published, going to conferences, etc) they‚Äôre branded a sellout or ""lucky"" People hoard contacts and opportunities like they‚Äôre rationing during wartime.

Critique sessions are less about helping each other grow, more about performing intelligence. Everyone‚Äôs laser-focused on nitpicking comma splices while ignoring what actually works in a piece. The goal isn‚Äôt to improve. It's to keep everyone equally average.

Oh, and god forbid you write genre fiction. Literary writers scoff. Genre writers roll their eyes at anything that dares to have symbolism or ambiguity. Everyone's busy looking down their noses at someone.

The result is that the group becomes a cozy little swamp of mutual stagnation. Safe and quietly toxic to any real ambition.

Now, I‚Äôll admit: I‚Äôm probably a bit bitter. Maybe even jealous. I see posts about supportive groups that help each other finish drafts, land agents, launch books. That‚Äôs beautiful. Good for you. I just haven‚Äôt found it.

I‚Äôm not a great writer. I'm not even a good writer. I‚Äôm average. But I work. I show up. I study craft, submit, revise, and try to get better. I don‚Äôt understand why so many people in these groups act like their first draft is sacred and everyone else‚Äôs work is garbage.

Why even come to a writing group if you think you have nothing to learn?

Anyway. Rant over.",3295,720,2025-08-05,somethinggoeshere2,Discussion,0.94
"""I can't make a plot""? You don't have a story!","Apologies in advance, but I‚Äôm going to call a lot of you out. Things need to be said.

I‚Äôve been writing fiction for 20+ years now. Writing used to look like this: Person imagines things ‚Üí Person has story inside of him/her that is yearning to get out ‚Üí Person writes story ‚Üí Person wrote the story. The whole process worked from the inside out. Something ignites inside you and burns so unimaginably hot that you can‚Äôt help but to put them into writing, lest it burn itself away leaving a hole where your heart used to be. You are literally **driven** by this story inside you, so the story manifesting into form is only inevitable. The story was there all along. You just deliver it.

Nowadays we see people asking the dumbest things ever: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do‚Äù, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt plot‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat happens next to my character?‚Äù, ‚ÄúI wrote myself into a corner‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to stay motivated?‚Äù, ‚ÄúI can worldbuild, but I have no idea how to make a story‚Äù. Brother, that‚Äôs because you **don‚Äôt have a freaking story** to begin with!

Here‚Äôs what writing looks like now, and why it produced a lot of failed, unfinished aspirations: Person consumes cool media ‚Üí Person wants to be cool too ‚Üí Person wants to write story ‚Üí Person stumped. This person is only enamored with the **idea** of writing, not writing itself. This person does not have a story of their own, something that burns in them and drives the process from the inside out. This person romanticizes their unwritten stories, which never existed to begin with. When they actually tried to pour them into writings, they are confused, stuck, lost, which makes all the fucking sense in the world because it‚Äôs impossible to write **nothing** and expecting **something** to come out!

Do the world a favor, now: **get bored**. Get off those small screens you hold for up to six goddamned hours a day. Sit still and let your mind wander. Find your story. Find that series of exhilarating and meaningful events inside you that you‚Äôve always wanted to write. Experience them yourself. Savor in this cycle of positive feedback where you create things and enjoy it at the same time, made possible by the great miracle that is the human narrative brain. You are the universe experiencing itself, after all.

Find your teenager elves crossing the magical valley to find her long-lost goblin friend. Find your middle-aged swashbuckler doing all he can to hop on the fabled treasure-hunting airship to discover that floating island he had been dreaming of since his childhood. Find your pale-skinned sickly girl enlisting in the soldiery to defend her space station in the Grand Galactic War. Find out what Jason would do to be together with Jenna for just a minute longer.

**Only after then**, write.",2444,602,2025-07-10,Which_Bumblebee1146,N/A,0.82
"If your novel was set in America, would you use American English?","Bit of a random topic but I'm intrigued as to what others may think. I'm Australian, but my current project is set in the US. Would you use American or Australian English? (Assuming I'm not a crazy successful author that will be publishing multiple different languages worldwide). 

Of course you'd assume you'd write in the language of your audience, but could it be part of the experience to read the American characters in US English? Could you switch between and have only the dialogue in US English? Do I say ""Stewart took out the trash"" or ""Stewart took out the rubbish""? Did he stroll down the sidewalk or the pathway? I have no bloody idea!

I'm sure to some it seems ridiculous I'm even thinking of this, but in my day job I switch between US and AUS English so it's something I think about a lot. I even wrote an InDesign script to change text language automatically so I don't have to proof as heavily (if this would be useful to anyone I am considering making it a public download on my website but telling people to download and run a random JavaScript sounds dodgy as all hell).

I think this is really a conversation for English only, obviously if it was set in France I wouldn't write the book in French. Are there any other languages that could be comparable to the differences between US and Australian English?
